== General principles == general-principles

=== Main menu === main-menu

Each application has a main menu. The main menu usually gives access to most
functions that can be used in the application, as well as to the application
settings and help.


You can access the menu with >>F10<<, move in the menu with arrow keys and
select with >>ENTER<<. The left and right keys select among the items in the
top level menu (such as 'File', 'Edit', 'Tools', 'Help'). Up and Down arrow
keys select among items in submenus (such as 'Open', 'Save', 'Save As',
'Close'). Sometimes an item in a submenu itself has a submenu. Then pressing
the Right key once will open the submenu and again, you can move in it by up
and down keys. Pressing the Left key will close the submenu, while pressing the
Right key again will skip to another item in the top level menu.

Hint: It is perhaps better to always use the left key to move in the top level
menu and only use the right key to open submenus.

Shortcuts:

:>>F10<<: Go to application main menu
:>>Up or Down<<: Choose from submenu
:>>Right<<: Next item in top-level menu or open submenu if any
:>>Left<<: Previous item in top-level menu or close submenu (if open)

=== Context menu === context-menu

Context menu is not associated with the application as such, but with
a particular object in the application. Object can be a file, an edit
field, a piece of text or a contact in an instant messenger. Context
menu is opened on the given object and it offers actions that can be
done with it.

Usually, pressing >>ENTER<< on the object will perform the default
action, but there are usually many more actions available in the
context menu.

To bring up a context menu, select an object and press >>Shift+F10<<.

Examples:
 * To compress a folder into a .zip archive, find the folder in the File
browser, open its context menu, then choose 'Archive...' from the context menu.
 * To check the size of an image, find the image, open its context menu, then
   choose 'Properties'.
 * To open a link in the web browser in a new window instead of the existing
window, find the link, then chose 'Open in new window' from the context menu.

Shortcuts:
:>>Shift+F10<<: Open context menu

=== Keyboard shortcuts logic === keyboard-shortcuts-logic

:>>Ctrl<<+combination: Combinations with >>Ctrl<< key trigger various actions (e.g. >>Ctrl+u<< undo)
:>>Alt<<+combination: Combinations with >>Alt<< key are used for menu access and manipulating with application windows
:>>Shift<<+combination: >>Shift<< is often used to reverse an action (e.g. >>Ctrl+u<< -- Undo, >>Shift+Ctrl+u<< -- Redo)

=== Navigation === navigation

Accessing menus, applications and windows:

:>>Alt+F1<<: Go to desktop main menu
:>>Alt+F2<<: Launch application by its name
:>>Alt+TAB<<: Cycle forward through currently open windows (Shift+Alt+TAB cycles in the other direction)

Navigation among widget inside the application:

:>>Tab<<: Move to the next widget/control (>>Shift+Tab<< moves to previous widget/control)
:>>Ctrl+Tab<<: Move to the next widget/control in editable fields or where >>Tab<< alone has another function (reverse is >>Shift+Ctrl+Tab<<)
:>>F6<<: Switch to next pane -- usually between most important sections in the contents of current window (>>Shift+F6<< previous pane)
:>>Ctrl+F1<<: Show/hide tooltip (if any) for the current element
:>>Ctrl+Alt-PgUp<<: Switch between tabs in the application (opposite direction >>Ctrl+Alt+PgDown<<)
:>>Space<<: Toggle checkbox
:>>ENTER<<: Select menu item or press button

=== Orca screen reader === orca

Orca is today the primary screen reader for the Gnome desktop. If not started
yet, you can start it with '>>Alt-F2 orca<<'. It launches as an independent
application with Settings, Quit and Help buttons.  It can be controlled using
key combinations (shortcuts) from any other application.

Orca offers two default layouts for key combinations. The *desktop layout*
makes use of the numerical block on keyboard, but the *laptop layout* has to
deal without it as most laptops do not have a separate numerical block.

Most important difference is in the use of base key for many Orca shortcuts,
usually called the Orca key:

:Orca key in Desktop mode: >>Insert<<
:Orca key in Laptop mode: >>Caps Lock<<

==== General ==== orca-general

:>>Orca+Space<<: Launch the Orca Configuration dialog.
:>>Orca+s<<: Toggle speech on and off.
:>>Orca+q<<: Quit Orca.

==== Flat review ==== orca-flat-review

Flat review offers an opportunity to examine the contents of the screen without
moving the cursor from its original position.

In desktop mode, flat review keys are located in the numerical keypad block. In
laptop mode, the shortcuts use the Orca key together with the keyboard segment
between keys 7, 9, dot and coma.

:>>Numpad-minus<< (>>Orca+P<<): Toggle between flat review and cursor tracking

Reading by lines:

:>>Numpad-7 (Orca+U)<<: Previous line -- Move the flat review cursor to the previous line and read it.
:>>Numpad-8 (Orca+I)<<: This line -- Read the current line.
:>>Numpad-9 (Orca+O)<<: Next line -- Move the flat review cursor to the next line and read it.

Reading by words:

:>>Numpad-4 (Orca+J)<<: Previous word -- Move the flat review cursor to the previous word and read it.
:>>Numpad-5 (Orca+K)<<: This word -- Read the current word.
:>>Numpad-6 (Orca+L)<<: Next word -- Move the flat review cursor to the next word and read it.

Reading by characters:

:>>Numpad-1 (Orca+M)<<: Previous character -- Move the flat review cursor to the previous character and read it.
:>>Numpad-2 (Orca+coma)<<: This character -- Read the current character.
:>>Numpad-3 (Orca+period)<<: Next character -- Move the flat review cursor to the next character and read it.

Mouse clicks at location of the flat-review cursor:

:>>Numpad-slash (Orca+7)<<: Left mouse click
:>>Numpad-star (Orca+8)<<: Right mouse click

Other:

:>>Numpad-Plus<<: Read all -- reads from the current position of the caret to the end of the document.
:>>Numpad-Enter<<: Where am I -- Speaks information such as the title of the current application window, as well as the name of the control that currently has focus.

==== Tables ==== orca-tables

:>>Orca+F11<<: Rows or cells -- Toggle the reading of tables, either by single cell or whole row.

==== Learn mode ==== orca-learn-mode

To examine the functions of various keys and keyboard shortcuts in the given
situation, you can always enter the learn mode with >>Orca+H<<.  In the learn
mode, you can press any key or keyboard shortcut and it will announce its name
and tell what it would be supposed to do, but doesn't actually do anything
(except for >>Escape<< which exits the learn mode).

Be aware however that Orca only announces functions of keyboard combinations
that belong to it. Many useful combinations are provided by the application
itself and you can't discover them this way.

Shortcuts:

:>>Orca+H<<: Enter into Orca's ``learn mode''
:>>ESC<<: Exit from ``learn mode''

==== Advanced ==== orca-advanced

:>>Orca+F<<: Speak font and attribute information for the current character.

=== Enhanced Zoom Desktop Magnifier === enhanced-zoom-desktop

Enhanced Zoom Desktop is a magnifier embedded directly into the Compiz window
manager, and thus part of every standard Ubuntu Natty installation. It also
includes focus tracking and mouse cursor enhancements.

For instructions on how to set it up, please see
[gnu-configuration#enhanced-zoom-desktop] .

==== Zooming ====

The most convenient way to zoom in and out is using the Super (also Windows)
button and the mouse scroll wheel. This makes it easy to adjust the zoom level
quickly to every situation, so that the user can have both a good overview of
the screen and the necessary detail.

It is also possible to define three specific fixed zoom levels and assign
shortcuts to them so that when pressed, these shortcuts bring the exact
predefined value of zoom.

==== Mouse tracking  ====

There are two modes for mouse tracking: Sync Mouse and Pan Area. The Sync Mouse
method tries to always keep the mouse pointer in the middle of the screen, thus
each movement of the mouse also moves the screen picture.  In the Pan Area
mode, the screen picture is moved only when the mouse cursor reaches the edge
of the display.

=== Orca Magnifier === orca-magnifier

The authors of this handbook were not able to get Orca Magnifier to work
properly on Ubuntu Natty, perhaps due to our hardware, drivers, or other
circumstances. We definitely encourage you to try it, but if the magnified
image gets distorted soon, this is a similar behavior as on our computers, and
we are not aware of any easy fix. In such case, plase see
[#enhanced-zoom-desktop].

=== Applications === applications

Below you can find a list of common keyboard shortcuts that can be found
across different applications. Not all of them might work or have sense for a
particular application.

:>>Ctrl+G<<: Find next -- Find the next match
:>>Ctrl+H<<: Replace -- Find and replace matches

Text zoom:

/The following keys manipulate the font size in a document, such as a webpage
or an office document. They just increase and decrease the view of the font
sizes, they have no relation with magnifying glass technologies./

:>>Ctrl+Plus<<: Zoom In -- Zoom in on the document
:>>Ctrl+Minus<<: Zoom Out -- Zoom out of the document
:>>Ctrl+0<<: Normal Size -- Restore to zoom level to normal size

=== Login and Logout === login-and-logout

To start your computer and login:
 1) Power the computer on.
 2) Wait a minute or two until you hear the sound of drums.
 3) Press >>ENTER<< to choose the last logged in user, then type your password, confirm with >>ENTER<<.
 4) If your login is successful you will hear the login melody. If not, repeat.

Be aware that repeated failures to login, if you have more users defined in the
system, might be due to the fact that you are choosing an incorrect user by
pressing the first >>ENTER<<. In such a case, you might need sighted help.

To shut down the computer:
 1) Press >>Ctrl+Alt_Delete<<
 2) A new 'Shutdown computer' dialog will appear in a  separate window.
 2) In case the dialog doesn't have focus, cycle through the available windows with >>Alt+TAB<< to find it.
 3) Choose whether you want to shutdown the computer, hibernate, put in sleep mode or restart.

Shortcuts:

:Ctrl-Alt-Delete: Bring up the 'Shutdown computer' dialog

=== Desktop main menu === desktop-main-menu

From the desktop main menu, you can launch applications, access directories on
your disk or system settings.  To get to the menu, press >>Alt+F1<<. To move
between the items, use the arrow keys.

Shortcuts:

:>>Alt+F1<<: Go to desktop main menu

== Reading mail == reading-mail

=== Thunderbird === thunderbird

==== Setup account ==== thunderbird-setup-account

To setup a new mail account:

 1) Go to the main application menu using >>F10<< and down arrow
 2) Under the menu item File, select New, press right arrow to open the submenu
 3) Select 'Mail account'
 4) Fill in your full name, email address and password for the account, press
    'Continue' button
 5) Thunderbird will try to guess the other details. This however often doesn't
    work, so it is perhaps a good idea to go find the 'Manual settings...' button
    and check the details in the account settings dialog. (Note that this button
    will only appear after the auto-discovery finishes, so you may have to wait a
    little).
 6) The settings for your outgoing (SMTP) mail server can be found in the same
    dialog window, but under different card. Move back to the list of available
    cards by pressing >>F6<< and move in it using up and down arrows.

==== Subscribe IMAP folders ==== thunderbird-subscribe-imap-folders

If have an IMAP account (which we highly recommend), you first need to
subscribe all the folders you want to receive.

 1) Go to the main application menu using F10 and down key
 2) Under 'File', choose 'Subscribe folders...'
 3) In the dialog window that opens you can find a drop-down menu of items and
    related to it a list of folders available for each account under 'Folder
    List'.
 4) Next to each folder in the list is a checkbox, in Ubuntu Maverick and
    perhaps elsewhere it is however not accessible
    [[https://its.freebsoft.org/its/issues/3149 bug #3149]].
 5) Even without sighted help, you can browse the collapsable tree
    of folders and choosing whether to subscribe or unsubscribe them using
    the 'Subscribe' and 'Unsubscribe' buttons. You however can't see the current
    state.
 6) To subscribe all folders, push Subscribe while on the top level item
    (usually 'INBOX' or similar').

==== Read messages ==== thunderbird-read

The main Thunderbird window has by default three panes (areas):
 1. List of accounts and folders (such as Inbox, Sent, Drafts...)
 2. List of mails in the selected folder
 3. Contents of the selected email
We recommend to switch the contents view off, see
[gnu-configuration#thunderbird-recommendation Thunderbird configuration]

You can cycle between these panes using >>F6<< forward and >>Shift+F6<<
backward. Thus pressing >>F6<< on a folder will bring you to the list of emails
and pressing >>F6<< again will bring you to the email contents or back to the
list of folders.

You can easily open the contents of a message in a new tab by pressing ENTER on
it. To examine the contents of an email line by line, simply press up and down
arrow keys. Flat review, on the other hand, is not available here. When you
finish reading, close it with >>Ctrl-w<<.

>>Ctrl+R<< will create a new message as a reply to the sender, >>Ctrl+Shift+R<<
means Reply to all.

There is of course more things you can do with the message. A full list of them
you can find in the 'Message' item of the main menu (access it through >>F10<<
and down arrow, then use right arrow key to find it)

Shortcuts:

:>>F6<<: Move between panes (Shift-F6 backwards)
:>>ENTER<<: Open message in different tab (in list of messages)
:>>Ctrl+w<<: Close tab
:>>Ctrl+PgUp<<: Move between tabs (Ctrl-PgDown backwards)

==== Write a message ==== thunderbird-write

The new message dialog has 4 areas which you can cycle through using >>F6<<:
 1. From -- your account selection
 2. Addresses -- Fields for To, Copy, Blank copy etc.
 3. Subject
 4. Text

To write a new message:
 1. Press >>Ctrl+N<< to start new message
 2. The focus is on the address field. Once you start typing the email address
    or the name of the recipient (To:), you can press the down arrow and choose
    from the offered completions.
 3. Pressing >>ENTER<< creates another address field. You can type another
    recipients address or press >>Shift+Tab<< and choose other kind of delivery
    (CC: -- copy, BCC: -- blind copy), then come back to the address input with
    >>Tab<<. The address area is actually a table of selections of delivery
    methods and corresponding addresses. You can create as many entries as
    necessary.
 4. When finished with addresses, press >>F6<< to go to the Subject field
 5. Then press >>F6<< to go to the text field and write the email text.
 6. If you want to add an attachment, you can do so from the main menu
    (>>F10<<).  Under File find Attach, press right arrow key to open submenu,
    choose File.
 7. To send the message, press >>Ctrl+ENTER<<
 8. To save the message as a draft, go to the main menu, under 'File' choose
    'Save as', then 'Draft'

==== Unread folders and messages ==== thunderbird-unread

# >>The below shortcuts using Alt need to be translated as
# they are different in different localizations<<

Messages:

:Display unread messages only: Alt-v e u or 'menu->View->Threads->Unread'
:Display all messages: Alt-v e a or 'menu->View->Threads->All'

Folders:

:Display folders with unread messages only: Alt-v f u or 'menu->View->Folders->Unread'
:Display all folders: Alt-v f a or 'menu->View->Folders->All'

==== Sort messages ==== thunderbird-sort

To sort messages using one of the available fields, select the 'View' item in
main menu, then open the subitem 'Sort by' using right arrow key.  From the
submenu, choose on of the offered fields ('Date', 'Subject', 'Received'...) and
confirm with 'ENTER'. Come again to the same submenu to choose whether the sort
should be ascending or descending.

Hint: 'Date' is the date when the email was written. If you want to sort mail
based on when it was received, use the 'Received' item. There can be a several
hours or even days difference. Some people like to write email on train or
other places with no internet connection, but send it only later when they
connect to internet. If you would sort by Date, not Received, such an email
would never appear on the top of the list, where you might be expecting it,
even if you have just received it.

==== Search for messages ==== thunderbird-search

 1. In the folder selection pane, choose the folder you want to search in
 2. Press >>Ctrl-f<< to move focus to the Search input field
 3. Type the text you want to search for
 4. By default, the text is searched in the 'From' field. There are buttons
    below this input field to search the text also in the 'To' field, in
    message text or other parts. They are however not accessible in Ubuntu
    Maverick. As a possible workaround, we suggest to use the Advanced search.

For Advanced search, use >>Ctrl-Shift-f<< or use 'Edit->Find->Search messages'
from the main menu (>>F10<<).

=== Gnus === gnus

Gnus is a mail reading application inside Emacs. It might require you to study
how to use it a little bit at first, but then its very powerful and speechd-el
makes it very accessible too.

You can launch gnus from inside Emacs by typing '>>M-x gnus<<'.

For detailed information how to setup accounts and how to use it,
see [http://www.gnus.org/manual/gnus_toc.html The Gnus Manual].

== Browsing web == browsing-web

=== Firefox === firefox

==== Navigation between pages ==== firefox-navigation-between-pages

:>>Ctrl+l<<: Enter a new location (URL or search term)
:>>Alt+Left<<: Go to previous visited page
:>>Alt+Right<<: Go to next visited page

To visit a page:
 1) Press >>Ctrl+l<< (>>location<<) to enter the address bar
 2) You can either type directly the URL of the page you want to see
    or just a series of words. If you type only words, Google will
    search for them and a webpage will display with the search results.

If you are interested in having more pages open at the same time and
switch between them, see [#firefox-tabbed-browsing].

==== Navigation inside a page ==== firefox-navigation-inside-page

You can read a page line by line using the up and down arrow keys. It
is however often more convenient to read through bigger sections or
search just for the part that you are interested. Below is a list of
the most common keyboard shortcuts with Orca:

Basic navigation:

:Down arrow: Next line (Up arrow previous line)
:>>Ctrl+Home<< or >>End<<: Go to top or bottom of the document

Landmark navigation:

:>>m<<: Next landmark (>>Shift+m<< previous)

Navigation over page items:
:>>Orca<<+Right: Go to next object (>>Orca<<+Left previous object)
:>>h<<: Next heading (Shift-1 previous)
:>>1<< or >>2,3,4,5,6<<: Next heading of the given level (>>Shift+1<< or >>2,3,4,5,6<< previous)
:>>p<<: Next paragraph (Shift-p previous)
:>>i<<: Next list item (Shift-i previous)
:>>r<<: Next live region (Shift-r previous)
:>>t<<: Next table (Shift-t previous)
:>>o<<: Next large object (Shift-o previous)
:>>Ctrl+Right<<: Next word (>>Ctrl+Left<< previous word)

#>>The following has doubtful usefulness:<<
# :>>u<< or >>v<<: Next unvisited or visited link (Shift-u or v previous)

Orca mode settings:
:>>Orca+z<<: Toggle structural navigation
:>>Orca+F12<<: Toggle between orca navigation and Firefox (Gecko) navigation

==== Tables ==== firefox-tables

:>>t<<: Next table (>>Shift+t<< previous)
:>>Shift+Alt<<+Arrow: Jump to table cell in given arrow direction (Up, Down, Left, Right)
:>>Shift+Alt+Home<< or >>End<<: Jump to first or last cell in the table

==== Forms ==== firefox-forms

:>>e<<: Next input field
:>>b<<: Next button
:>>Orca+Tab<<: Go to the next form field (>>Shift+Orca+Tab<< previous)
:>>Alt+Down<<: Expand combo box(left >>Alt<<)

==== Access keys ==== firefox-access-keys

Access keys often provide useful functionality, such as jump to page content or
jump to menu. There is however no standard definition for them and thus they
might be different in different web applications.

:>>Shift-Alt<<-key: Execute action defined for 'key'

==== Live regions ==== firefox-live-regions

:>>r<<: Next live region (>>Shift+r<< previous)
:>>\\<<: Advance the politeness level for the current live region
:>>Shift+\\<<: Set all live regions on page to politeness of 'off'
:>>Orca+F1<< or >>F2<< to >>F9<<: Review previously announced live region messages (>>F1<< most recent, >>F2<< last most recent etc.)

==== Tabbed browsing ==== firefox-tabbed-browsing

It is possible to keep multiple pages open inside the Firefox window and switch
between them as necessary. Only one of them is visible at once, but the other
ones also stay open, they are merely hidden visually, and you can bring them up
at any time.

To follow a link on the webpage, you have two options.  Pressing >>ENTER<< on
that link will replace the current page with the new page. Pressing
>>Ctrl+ENTER<< however will keep the current page, keep your focus there and
open your new page in another tab which you can examine later.

To open a new webpage, >>Ctrl+l<< will take you to the location bar where you
can type a new address and it will replace the page that you are currently
reading. >>Ctrl+t<< however will keep your page open, create a new tab and bring
you to its location bar. You can then read another page without having to
close to the former one, to which you can return later.

To move between the tabs, use >>Ctrl+PgUp<< and >>Ctrl+PgDown<<.

Shortcuts:

:>>Ctrl+ENTER<<: Open link in new tab
:>>Ctrl+t<<: Open new tab and place focus in its location bar
:>>Ctrl+w<<: Close the current tab
:>>Ctrl+PgUp<<: Move to previous tab
:>>Ctrl+PgDown<<: Move to the next tab
:>>Alt<<+number: Move to the tab with the given number (>>Alt+1<< first tab, >>Alt+2<< second tab etc.)

==== Bookmarks ==== firefox-bookmarks

You can create bookmarks on pages that you visit often or pages that you want
to visit later.

To create a bookmark on a page, open the page, then press >>Ctrl+D<<.  This
will open the bookmark dialog, where you can edit its title, then press the
Save button.

The Bookmarks are stored in the main menu. Access it using >>F10<<, press right
arrow key repeatedly to find the 'Bookmarks' item and browse your bookmarks
with up/down arrow keys. Pressing >>ENTER<< on any of them will open the
associated page in your current window.

If you want to do some other action with the selected bookmark, such as open it
in a new tab or to delete it, press >>Shift+F10<< to open the context menu and
choose the action you would like with up and down keys.

You can also group your bookmarks in folders, just see the other edit fields
and menu items.

Shortcuts:

:>>Ctrl+D<<: Bookmark this page

==== Full keyboard shortcuts reference for Firefox ==== firefox-shortcuts-reference

 * Orca mode for Firefox: [http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Firefox] (incomplete)
 * Firefox itself: [http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/keyboard]

The complete list of Orca mode keyboard shortcuts you can find in the Orca
settings dialog for Firefox. While in Firefox, press >>Orca+Ctrl<<+Space, then
use >>Alt+PgUp<< or >>Alt+PgDown<< to find the Keyboard shortcuts tab.

== Managing files == managing-files

There are two basic methods to manage files and folders. One is using the
Nautilus application and second is from command line.

=== Nautilus === nautilus

Nautilus is the default file browser in Gnome. It has a menu, a location bar
displaying the current address and two panes (areas).

The left pane, by default, displays Places -- disks on your system, external
drives, your camera, network folders. It also contains bookmarks to some common
destinations like your home directory or your Documents directory.  The pane
can be switched to display other things also, like history of your browsing.

The right pane is used to browse the files and folders and perform
actions on them.

The location bar is similar to the address field in a web browser.  It shows
where you currently are in the file system hierarchy but it also allows you to
write or paste a concrete location on your system.

==== Launching Nautilus ==== nautilus-launching

 1) Go to the main menu by pressing >>Alt+F1<< anywhere on the desktop
 2) Using right arrow, move to the main item 'Places'
 3) Using down arrow, choose the place (disk, device or bookmark)
 4) Press >>ENTER<< to launch Nautilus at the selected place

==== Browsing files ==== nautilus-browsing-files

The browse pane of Nautilus can work in two modes, Icon view and list view. You
can switch between them by pressing >>Ctrl+1<< and >>Ctrl+2<< anywhere in the
application. We recommend to switch to list view (>>Ctrl+2<<). Nautilus will
remember this and use this view also next time.

In list view (>>Ctrl+2<<), you can browse the directory structure like a tree
menu by Up and Down arrow keys, while you enter deeper into directories or
return back from them by Right and Left keys.

In icon view (>>Ctrl+1<<), you can browse files with all the arrow keys
and you must press >>Alt-Up<< and >>Alt-Down<< to go up and down in the
directory hierarchy.

Use the >>F6<< key to cycle between the file list, the location bar and
the Places pane (or >>Shift+F6<< to cycle backwards).

For example to find a directory 'photo/norway' on an external device called
'Camera':

 0) Switch to list view using >>Ctrl+2<< if you have not already done so
 1) Go to the Places pane using >>Shift+F6<<
 2) Use up/down keys to choose the 'Camera' device
 3) Press >>F6<< to go back to file browser
 4) Use up/down keys to find the 'photo' folder, press >>ENTER<< on it
 5) Now use up/down keys to find the 'norway folder
 6) You can enter the folder by pressing >>ENTER<< or do some other action
    with it by opening the context menu using >>Shift+F10<<

==== Copying files ==== nautilus-copying-files

 1) Find the file or directory you want to copy
 2) Press >>Ctrl+C<< on it (or >>Ctrl+X<< if you want to move)
 3) Go into the directory you want to place it in
 4) Press >>Ctrl+V<<

==== Operations with files and folders ==== nautilus-operations-files-folders

If you want to delete, rename or make a '.zip' archive from a file or folder:

 1) Find the file or folder you want to do something with
 2) Launch the context menu using >>Shift+F10<<
 3) Choose the action which you want to do ('delete', 'rename', 'archive', ...)

==== Connecting and disconnecting external devices ==== nautilus-connecting-and-disconnecting

External devices are usually connected automatically when you plug the
cables or the card into the reader. When you finish working with them
however, you can't just plug the cable out as that could result in
loss of data. Thus you need to tell the system to disconnect the device first:

 1) Go to the 'Places' pane (use >>F6<<)
 2) Choose the device you want to disconnect
 3) Open the context menu using >>Shift+F10<<
 4) From the available actions, select 'Disconnect'

==== Shortcuts overview ==== nautilus-shortcuts-overview

:>>Ctrl+1<<: Icon view
:>>Ctrl+2<<: List view
:>>F6<<: Move between locations and directory listing
:>>Alt+HOME<<: Return to home directory
:>>Ctrl+H<<: Move cursor to location bar
:>>Shift+F10<<: Open context menu. If open on files or folders, lists actions available on them (like 'Copy', 'Rename' etc.)
:>>Ctrl+H<<: Show/hide hidden files
:>>F2<<: Rename
:>>DEL<<: Move into trash
:>>Shift-DEL<<: Delete immediately (irreversible)

=== Command line === command-line-files-

Many times, it can be more convenient to use textual commands and manipulate
files on the command line. One must have a basic knowledge of the commands that
are available, but for details, he/she can always consult the embedded help. It
is not even necessary to type much as the shell can complete commands and names
of files automatically once you type the first few letters.

Shortcuts:

:>>Ctrl+Alt+t<<: Launch terminal (command line)
:>>TAB<<: Complete a command, parameter or filename or list available options if more than one exist

==== Basic file manipulation ==== command-line-files-basic

:>>ls: list contents of a folder ('ls -lh' including information on each file)
:>>cp<< file location: Copy file (also folder) to location (file or folder)
:>>mv<< file location: Move file (also folder) to location (file or folder)
:>>rm<< file: Permanently remove a file ('>>rm -rf<< directory' to remove non-empty directories)
:>>mkdir<< folder_name: Create a folder (it is a shortcut for 'make directory')

This section is here just to explain the basic idea and show that this way of
work can be actually quite easy and fast.

You can obtain a brief help on every commands function and parameters
if you execute it with the '--help' parameter, e.g. 'cp --help'. To obtain
more detailed help, type 'man command' (e.g. man cp). 'man' stands for
manual.

==== Example ==== command-line-files-example

To move a file 'ubuntu-accessibility.txt' from folder '/home/joe/' into a new
folder '/home/joe/notes',

 1. >>cd<< (change directory to the home folder)
 2. >>ls<< (see the contents of the directory if you wish)
 3. >>mkdir notes<< (create a new directory 'notes')
 4. >>mv ubun<<
 5. Press >>TAB<< to complete, you should now see: >>'mv
    ubuntu-accessibility.txt'<<
 6. Type >>notes<<
 7. Now you have '>>mv ubuntu-accessibility.txt notes<<', press >>ENTER<<
 8. Type '>>ls notes<<' and >>ENTER<< to verify that the file is in there

To copy all .txt files into a folder 'documents':
 * >>cp \*.txt documents ENTER<<
or just
 * >>cp \*.txt docu TAB ENTER<<

== Creating documents == creating-documents

Various documents (such as papers, letter, spreadsheets or presentation) can be
created with the OpenOffice.org package.

To launch OpenOffice, press >>Alt+F2<<, then type '>>openoffice.org<<' and
press >>ENTER<<.

There are several different components inside OpenOffice that can be used for
different tasks. These are:

:OpenOffice Writer: Word processor (documents, letters etc.)
:OpenOffice Calc: Table calculator (spreadsheets)
:OpenOffice Impress: Conference style presentations

When you launch OpenOffice, it will offer various options what to create, as
well as the possibility to open a file.  Based on your decision, the
appropriate application will open.

You can later close the document without closing OpenOffice by accessing
the 'File->Close' function or by pressing Alt-f c.

=== OpenOffice Writer === openoffice-writer

Writer is a word processor that can be used to read or create documents,
letters etc.

The default view includes four main components which you can browse using >>F6<<
and >>Shift+F6<<:
 1. the main menu -- near to all actions are available from main menu
 2. standard tools -- most common tools and actions (such as save, open,
    print, create table etc.)
 3. formatting tools -- formatting (such as text style, font, size,
    paragraph alignment etc.)
 4. document edit box -- the contents of the document

==== Creating a simple document ==== openoffice-writer-simple-document

This is just an example, we will create a document with a heading and
a paragraph.

 0. Open Openoffice.Org, choose 'Text document'
 1. This will start the application with an empty document, cursor
    placed into the edit box
 2. Write a text for the heading, for example 'My Story'
 3. Press >>Ctrl+1<< to assign the current paragraph the 'Heading 1' style
 4. Start a new line (move to end of the first one using >>END<< key and press
    >>ENTER<<
 5. Type the text of the first paragraph of your story, do not split lines
    using >>ENTER<<. Lines are wrapped automatically, >>ENTER<< serves to
    create new paragraphs.
 6. Press >>Ctrl-S<< to save the document using the standard 'Save' dialog

==== Review of formatting ==== openoffice-writer-review-of-formatting

You can review the formatting of the document by using the >>Orca+f<< keyboard
shortcut in different places in the document. It will announce font family and
size of the current letter, but also OpenOffice style (if any) for the given
word (such as 'Normal text' or 'Heading 2').

==== Movement ==== openoffice-writer-movement

:Right, Left: Move by characters
:>>Ctrl<<-Right, >>Ctrl<<-Left: Move by words
:Up, Down: Move by lines
:>>Ctrl<<-Up, >>Ctrl<<-Down: Move by paragraphs

:>>HOME, END<<: Move to beginning or end of line
:>>Ctrl-HOME, Ctrl-END<<: Move to beginning or end of document

==== Selections ==== openoffice-writer-selections

:>>Ctrl-Shift-s<<: Select current paragraph (Note: This is a [gnu-configuration#openoffice-writer-shortcuts custom shortcut], you need to define it first.)
:>>Ctrl-Shift-Down<<: Select till the end of paragraph
:>>Ctrl-a<<: Select all -- everything in the whole document
:>>Shift-END<<: Select till the end of line

==== Text style, paragraph alignment and fonts ==== openoffice-writer-aligment-and-fonts

Simple style and formatting changes are best done using shortcuts:

:>>Ctrl+0<<: Change current paragraph to normal text
:>>Ctrl+1<< to >>Ctrl+5<<: Change current paragraph to heading 1 (biggest) to 5 (smallest)

:>>Ctrl+l<<: Align current paragraph left
:>>Ctrl+r<<: Align current paragraph right
:>>Ctrl+j<<: Justify current paragraph into block


To apply font properties, you must first select a piece of text you want to
apply them to. See [#openoffice-writer-selections]. Otherwise they will get
applied to all text you will type later.

:>>Ctrl+b<<: Toggle 'bold' property on selected text on and off
:>>Ctrl+i<<: Toggle 'italics' property on selected text on and off
:>>Ctrl+u<<: Toggle 'underline' property on selected text on and off

To access all other formatting options (such as size of text, line spacing or
font family), press >>Shift-F10<< to bring up the context menu on the selected
text. Browse it using the arrow keys and select with >>ENTER<<.

==== Create a table ==== openoffice-writer-create-table

Go to main menu (>>F10<<) and select 'Table->Insert->Table' . This will bring
up an 'Insert table' dialog. Choose name for the table and its size. >>ENTER<<
will confirm the dialog and insert the table in your document. You can enter it
using arrow keys as well as move among its cells.

To include a row or column, or delete a row or column, use the
context menu (>>Shift+F10<<) while inside one of the tables cells.

==== Spell checking ==== openoffice-writer-spell-checking

To be able to use spell checking, it is necessary to first set a correct
language for the document. This can be done in main menu, 'Tools->Language->For
all text...'

Spell checking for the whole document can be started by pressing >>F7<<.

On every error the spell checker finds, a dialog window will appear. The dialog
displays the part of the sentence where the error was found, a list of
suggested corrections and several action buttons ('Change, Ignore, Add to
dictionary'). When the dialog appears, the 'Change' button is focused.

To examine the text that is supposed to contain a mistake and the proposed
variants, use >>Shift+TAB<< to move up to see the two areas.

 * If the word is actually correct in the given language, use Add to add it
   to the dictionary
 * If you want to ignore this warning, use Ignore button
 * To correct by choosing from the offered alternatives, choose the desired one
   and press >>ENTER<<
 * To correct the mistake in another way, go to the window that displays the
   suspicious text, make any changes, use TAB to come back to the Change button
   and then press >>ENTER<<

If another possible mistake is found, another window will appear. At the end, a
window will appear to say that the spell check is complete. Close it by
pressing the 'OK' button. This will take you back to the document edit box.

Shortcuts:

:>>F7<<: Check Spelling and grammar

=== Openoffice Calc  === openoffice-calc

Openoffice Calc is a table calculator. It can be navigated similar to
OpenOffice Writer (use F6 to cycle between main parts, cursor arrows to move
around).

The power of table calculators lies in the fact that some of the cells in the
table can include automatic formulas which display the result of some action
performed on the surrounding data (e.g. the sum of cells, a condition or the
result of a search). Each time something in the data changes, these cells are
automatically recalculated. Thus complicated interactive and interconnected
sheets of data can be created.

The below sections will not teach you how to work with a table calculator, but
will offer a few examples to get you started. For more information, see
[http://documentation.openoffice.org/manuals OpenOffice.org Manuals].

==== Entering values ====

To include a value (number, text or for example a data):
 1) Navigate to the cell you want to edit
 2) If you want to overwrite the current value, just start typing
 3) If you want to edit the current value instead, press >>F2<< to enter the edit field
 3) Press >>ENTER<< to confirm

==== Entering a formula ====

A formula can be either a simple mathematical formula (like A1+A2) or a
function. Each function has one or more arguments. For example, there is a
function called 'Sum' to sum all the numbers in a given region. It is most
convenient to know the common functions by their names and be able to type them
directly. If not, you can also use a guide to create the formula.

*Example how to create a summation formula*:
   1. Enter for example values 1, 2, 3 into cells B1, B2, B3
   2. Go to cell B4 and enter the text: '=Sum(B1:B3)'
   3. Press >>ENTER<<
   4. The cell B4 will display '6'
   5. To see the underlying formula instead of the result, press F2 while on
   the cell to enter the edit mode

*Example how to create a formula with the guide*
   1. Enter for example values 1, 2, 3 into cells B1, B2, B3
   2. Now we want to display the average of the three cells in cell B5
      but we do not know the name of the corresponding function
   3. Go to cell B5
   4. Use F6 to enter the formula pane
   5. Use Right arrow key to find 'Function wizard' and select with ENTER
   6. From the 'Category' drop down menu choose the family of functions you are
      interested in (e.g. Mathematical, Logical, Text). Choose 'Statistical'.
   7. Press >>TAB<< to go to the selection of the concrete function to
      use. Find 'Average' but do not confirm with >>ENTER<<.
   8. Use >>TAB<< to find the 'Next' button.
   9. The next page of the dialog displays functions arguments. You can
      use numbers, table cells (such as A5) or ranges of cells (such as A1:B1).
      Type in 'B1:B3' and press >>ENTER<<.
   10. The cell B5 will now display '2', which is the average of numbers
       1, 2 and 3.
   11. To see the formula, not the result, press >>F2<<. You can also learn the
       formula and type it without the guide next time.

*Example on automatic recalculation*
   1. Complete one of the previous examples. You will have
      numbers 1, 2, 3 in table cells B1, B2, B3 and their
      sum (6) in cell B4 and/or average in cell B5 (2).
   2. Go to cell B1 and type '4', then press >>ENTER<<.
   3. Now go back to cells B4 and/or B5 and see how they changed.
   4. The sum in B4 now displays 9 and the average in B5 displays 3.

==== Switching sheets ====

Every document can have either one or more sheets of data. All sheets from one
document and they can be interconnected. E.g. results on one sheet can depend
on data in another one.

In OpenOffice, the sheets are represented as tabs and you can use the standard
key combinations >>Ctrl+PgUp<< and >>Ctrl+PgDown<< to move between them.

==== Shortcuts ====

:>>F2<<: Start editing a cell
:>>Ctrl+PgUp<<: Move to previous sheet
:>>Ctrl+PgDown<<: Move to next sheet

Main menu, 'Tools->Customize', card 'Keyboard' (>>Ctrl-PgDown<<)
contains a list of all available shortcuts as well as a possibility
to define new ones.

=== OpenOffice Impress === openoffice-impress

We are not going to cover work with presentations in this basic guide. It is
however possible to create presentations without sight and there are special
ways how to give the presentations (the challenge of course is to access what
is displayed on the big screen without disturbing the picture for the viewers).

More information can be found here:
 * [http://ui.openoffice.org/accessibility/]
 * [http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/presenter-screen]

== Virtual Computer == virtual-computer

=== VMmare Player === vmware

VMware Player can be started from the main desktop menu (>>Alt+F1<<) as 'System
Tools->VMware Player'.

==== Create a new virtual machine ==== vmware-new-machine

To install another operating system in a virtual machine, follow the below
steps. Please note however that this is an example. Depending on which system
are you installing, some of the steps might be slightly different:

 0. Start VMware Player
 1. If you are launching VMware Player for the first time, license dialog
    appears, agree to it to continue
 2. Press >>F10<< to access the main menu
 3. Under 'File', choose 'Create new virtual machine'
 4. A dialog window will open where you have to specify some details
 5. Choose whether you want to install the new operating system from an ISO
    file or CD/DVD drive
 6. VMware knows how to install some of the systems and might offer you to do
    an 'Easy Install'. This means that it will just ask you a few questions at
    the beginning and then complete the whole installation process without your
    intervention. This is recommendable. (If you want to go through a normal
    installation, choose 'I will install operating system later'. Press 'Next'
    button.
 7. Fill in the name, username and password you want for your user account
    in the new system. Press 'Next' button.
 8. Choose a name of the virtual machine and the directory on your file system
    where to store it. Press 'Next' button.
 9. Choose how much space can the virtual machine use on your disk.
    Press 'Next' button.
 10. The virtual machine will use virtual hardware. There is a step where you
     can customize the details, such as how much RAM to use, but you can also
     leave them as they are and change them later if necessary.
 11. Press 'Finish' button to start the installation process.

This last step will close the dialog and start booting the machine and
installing it. Since now, what is running inside the main player window is your
new virtual computer. Installation will only be accessible if the installer of
the operating system you have chosen itself is accessible (just as if you are
installing on a real computer). To see how you can use it, continue to
[#vmware-using-machine].

==== Starting and stopping virtual machine ==== vmware-start-stop-machine

To *start* a virtual machine:
 1. Start VMware player
 2. Use Up and Down arrow keys to choose the machine you want to start.
 3. Press >>ENTER<< to start it
 4. Now see [#vmware-using-machine]. We recommend to wait a minute or two until
    the machine finishes booting before switching into it, because otherwise
    you might experience some problems with wrong cursor grabbing.

There are two options to *suspend* the virtual machine. You can either use the
suspend function in your operating system inside the machine or you can suspend
the whole machine from VMware control menu. We recommend the later method:
 1. If inside the machine, use >>Ctrl+Alt<< to leave it
 2. Press >>F10<< to enter the VMware menu
 3. Choose 'Virtual Machine->Power->Suspend'
This is a suspend to disk. The machine will use no resources or power on your
real computer when it is suspended.

To *shut down* or restart the virtual machine:
 1. Enter the machine with >>Ctrl+G<<
 2. Shutdown or reboot the system
 3. VMware will recognize when the operating system inside has shut down and
    will return focus back to your original system.
See [#vmware-using-machine].

==== Using virtual machine ==== vmware-using-machine

The VMware Player is like an ordinary application. It has a main menu and some
other widgets. Unlike in a normal application however, you can also use it to
enter inside the virtual machine. Once you are inside the virtual machine, you
can use it just as if it was a computer on itself, but there is a special key
combination to escape from it and come back to your original environment.

To *enter* inside the virtual machine:
 1. If the VMware Player application doesn't have focus yet, use >>Alt+TAB<< to
 find it.
 2. Once you are in VMware Player, press >>CTRL+g<< to enter it
 3. All your keyboard and mouse input will now go to the virtual machine

Note: If you can't enter the machine with >>Ctrl+g<<, it might be either because
the machine is not running (see [#vmware-start-stop-machine]) or because some
dialog window has appeared but didn't get focus. Use >>Alt+TAB<< to find it.

To *leave* the virtual machine:
 1. Press >>Ctrl+Alt<< to leave the machine
 2. The machine is still running, but your keyboard and mouse input now goes
to your original operating system.

Because >>Ctrl+Alt<< escapes the machine, it might sometimes be a problem that
it is not possible to use key combinations containing Ctrl+Alt inside the
virtual machine itself. If this is your case, we recommend to change the
escape combination to >>Ctrl+Alt+Shift<<. See
[gnu-configuration#vmware-player-escape the Configuration chapter, section VMWare]

Shortcuts:

:Ctrl+g: Enter virtual machine
:Ctrl+Alt: Leave virtual machine

==== Copy files to and from machine ==== vmware-copy-files

Copying files from and to virtual machine is very easy provided you have VMWare
Tools installed inside the machine, which is usually offered to you during
setup of any new virtual machine. Then the clipboard is shared between the
virtual machine and your host system, so you can just move a file or directory
into the clipboard (>>Ctrl+c<<) inside the virtual machine, leave the virtual
machine using >>Ctrl+Alt<< and paste the file into a directory in your home
system using >>Ctrl+v<<.

Additionally, in [gnu-configuration#vmware-player-machines virtual machine preferences],
you can setup shared directories between your host system and the system in your
virtual machine.
