= Installation of Festival on Ubuntu =

This applies to *Ubuntu Lucid* and *Maverick*. If you have an older version of
Ubuntu, we highly recommend to upgrade first.

== Step 1: Packages installation ==

First, we need to download and install the necessary packages. This
can be done in the graphical user interface or on the command line
as follows:

:Ubuntu UI: In [gnu-installation#synaptic Synaptic package manager], install festival *and* festival-freebsoft-utils
:Ubuntu Command: sudo apt-get install festival festival-freebsoft-utils

== Step 2: Launch script ==

In Ubuntu, the Festival package does not contain a launch script
[[https://its.freebsoft.org/its/issues/3143 bug #3143]]. Thus if you
are happy to launch Festival manually each time you want to use it by
typing the 'festival --server' command, you can skip this step. This
is however quite inconvenient, so we suggest to copy the script into
\/etc/init.d/festival and make it executable. It can be accomplished by the
following command:

-----
sudo install /usr/share/doc/festival/examples/festival.init /etc/init.d/festival
-----

The script needs to be enabled using a [festival.default default file] this way:

-----
sudo wget http://live.freebsoft.org/ubuntu-festival/attachments/festival.default -O /etc/default/festival
-----

Then you have to obtain a Festival configuration file. See section
[#festival-scm] to learn how to create/modify the file. If you do not want
to learn it now, you can download our pre-made file this way:

-----
sudo wget http://live.freebsoft.org/ubuntu-festival/attachments/festival.scm -O /etc/festival.scm
-----

Finally the init script then needs to be linked to the startup process and
started:

-----
sudo update-rc.d festival defaults
sudo /etc/init.d/festival start
-----

== Step 3: Install voices and add-ons ==

Your Festival should be installed and running by now. You might
however want to install some additional voices or sound libraries.
Go back to the [gnu-installation Installation page] to read more.

== Step 4 (optional): Create your Festival configuration file == festival-scm

Start with the contents of the \/usr/share/doc/festival/examples/festival.scm
file. When you are ready with it, copy it to the \/etc/festival.scm file.
You can use these elements to customize the configuration file:

 * event mappings: using event mappings, you can set e.g. how left arrow is
   spoken, or even that a sound is played instead of it. In general, you can
   map an input (word, keyboard key, or character) to its form of aural
   representation you prefer for it. Example:
   (set! word-mapping '(
         (")" sound "right-round-bracket")
         ("°" text "degree")
                       )
   )

   The example is setting up how 2 words are to be spoken. It sets up the word
   ")" (i.e. the left bracket) to be played as a pre-recorded sound with
   identifier "right-round-bracket". It also sets up the word "°" (the degree
   symbol) to be spoken as text "degree".

   Note that the pre-recorded sounds are usually not human speech, but rather
   short easily recognizable melody.
