= Environments on GNU/Linux =

Following are three big areas of the GNU/Linux platform, accessible for the
blind and visually handicapped, which can be of interest to you:

== Gnome desktop ==

[http://www.gnome.org/about/ GNOME] offers an easy to understand modern desktop
environment for a GNU/Linux computer. Near to all the available applications can
be operated from this interface, regardless whether they provide a graphical,
textual or another form of interface.

The Gnome desktop is made accessible mainly through the Orca screen reader. Orca
includes modules for voice, braille and magnification.

== Text console ==

Many applications and tools can also be operated from a purely textual
interface, although with some serious limitations. Some important things,
such as a modern internet browser, are not available in this environment.
Still it is a welcomed resort for many users in situations, when
they face some problems in the GNOME graphical desktop.

Although this is not crucial, a text console can be made fully
accessible (by voice and braille) using the following tools:
BrlTTY, eSpeakup and/or YASR.

== Emacs ==

Emacs is a very interesting environment, because it can bring the advantages
of a consistent fully textual user interface operated primarily by keyboard
onto the modern graphical desktop. It can only contain its own applications,
but the very wide range of tasks that can be accomplished with it, from editing
text, through managing files and developing applications, to reading mail
and typesetting notes, make it a primary work environment for many, not just
the handicapped users.

Be aware however that you will find you have to learn some things first
and understand its concepts. The efficiency of your work afterwards should
however be enough of a reward.

Several tools are available to make it accessible, but we highly recommend
to use speechd-el.
