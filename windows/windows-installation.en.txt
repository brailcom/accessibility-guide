== JAWS == jaws

A demoversion of JAWS can be downloaded from http://www.freedomscientific.com/
.  The demoversion is fully functional in the first 40 minutes after you start
it, then it deactivates itself and will work again only after you restart your
computer. JAWS is a proprietary software and if you would like to use it for
your daily work, you have to buy a license.

For more information visit the manufacturers website
http://www.freedomscientific.com/ .

=== Voices === jaws-voices

The online installation of JAWS comes with the default English 'Eloquent'
voice. To install other voices and voices for other languages, we recommend
to use JAWS with RealSpeak voices:

 * [http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/RealSpeak-Solo-Direct-Voices/RealSpeak-Solo-Direct-Downloads.asp RealSpeak Solo Direct Voices]

After you download your voices, you will set voice output to RealSpeak in JAWS
settings.

== NVDA == nvda

NVDA is open software and additionally, you can use it free of charge.

 1. Visit [http://www.nvda-project.org/wiki/Download]
 2. If you intend to use it for your own computer, we recommend to download the
    'Installer' version from 'Stable releases'

After download, allow your system to execute the install file and follow the
installation process.

=== Voices === nvda-voices

NVDA is by default installed with the eSpeak synthesizer and with support for
synthesizers supporting the Sapi 4 and 5 interfaces. The advantage of eSpeak is
its support for a wide variety of languages, the disadvantage is a low quality
of the voices.

NVDA can also be used with the Festival free speech synthesizer. Festival
offers high quality voices for some languages. A description of how to install
Festival with high quality Czech voices can be found in the Czech version of
this handbook.

== COBRA == cobra

A demo version of the COBRA screen reader, fully functional for a one
month period, can be downloaded from the internet. If you would like to
work with it after this period expires, you need to buy a license.

The demo version is available from the Website of the BAUM company:
