= Usage =

Usage of VoiceOver can be summarized as navigating through
contents of the application's screen, hearing the contents of the
currently navigated-to item, and optionally interacting with the
currently navigated-to item.

To be able to use VoiceOver for most basic tasks, you need to learn
just 3 gestures - we call this basic usage.  To take full advantage of
VoiceOver gestures for effective work with VoiceOver, you can study
the advanced usage section.

== Basic usage ==

=== Navigating using VoiceOver ===
To navigate using VoiceOver, you use touch gestures. The basic
navigation gestures are:

 * flick left: navigate to the previous item
 * flick right: naviaget to the next item

To be able to interact with the selected item, like open it, see next
section.

Another way to navigate items on screen is to simply touch the screen
and move your finger around.  VoiceOver will announce items on the
screen as you move your finger.

=== Interacting with content using VoiceOver ===

You can interact with an item depending on the type of item.

If the item is a button, you can double-tap it to activate the action
associated with the button. The associated action can be:

 * toggling a setting on or off (e.g. "Airplane Mode" in Settings app)
 * opening a new screen with content related to the description of the
   button (e.g. "WiFi" in Settings app)
 * performing an action described in the description of the button
   (e.g. "Send" button can send email in the Mail app)

Interacting with the item can change a numerical value, use "flick up"
and "flick down" gestures to increase or decrease the value,
respectively. This is for example:
 * the "Speaking Rate" slider in VoiceOver settings
 * name of day or month in calendar date editing control

== Advanced usage ==

You can refer to Apple's manual for advanced gestures.  We will just
sum up things you can do with VoiceOver to get you motivated to read
the manual:

 * touch typing
 * rotor, including its usage in web pages
 * scrolling through page for quicker navigation
 * navigating contacts using first letter of name
 * gesture for navigating one level back in hierarchical views

== Scenarios and tasks ==

=== Unlocking screen ===

Screen gets locked automatically after some time. When screen is
locked, you cannot interact with the device. The only thing the device
responds to in such case is request to unlock the screen.

To lock the screen, press the physical lock button located at the top
right part of your device.

To unlock the screen:
 * press either the home button or lock button
 * navigate with flicking right to "slide to unlock"
 * double-tap the screen
