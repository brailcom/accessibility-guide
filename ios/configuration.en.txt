There are 2 kinds of things that you have to configure on your iOS device:

 * setup - configure the settings without which you cannot use the iOS
   device with VoiceOver (like turning VoiceOver on or setting up
   Braille display if you want to use it)
 * preference - things that improve your experience, but you could do
   without them

Both setup and preferences are usually set in the VoiceOver
settings. To navigate to VoiceOver settings, follow these steps:

 * Get to the home screen of your device using the home button
 * Open the Settings app
 * Open the "General" item
 * Open the "Accessibility" item
 * Open the "VoiceOver" item

When you are in the VoiceOver settings, then follow the instructions
for the specific setup setting or preference.

== Setup ==

=== Turning VoiceOver on ===
==== Turning VoiceOver on from the computer during first setup ====
When you connect your iOS device to iTunes for the first time, you
have the option to select that the device should have VoiceOver turned
on.  In fact, if you are using iTunes itself with a screen reader
running, iTunes detects this and turns VoiceOver on your iOS device
automatically (this does not work on Mac OS X: see bug#???).
During the setup, you can also set up triple-click of
the home button to an accessibility-related action, like turning
VoiceOver on and off,  or turning zoom on and off.  The fact that you
can turn VoiceOver on iOS device on from your computer enables you to
unpack and setup the device without assistance of a sighted person.

You can turn VoiceOver on and off using iTunes during any sync. So if
you forget to turn it on during the first sync (and it did not turn on
by autodetection of Windows or Mac screenreader), you can turn
VoiceOver on during next sync.
==== Turning VoiceOver on manually on the device ====
If you forgot to turn VoiceOver on using iTunes and do not want to use
iTunes to do it (e.g. because you are away from your computer), you
can turn VoiceOver on on the device with assistance from the sighted
person.  Follow these steps:

 * Go to the home screen by pressing the Home button
 * Open the Settings app
 * Open the "General" item
 * Open the "Accessibility" item
 * Open the "VoiceOver" item
 * Turn the "VoiceOver" setting from "OFF" to "ON"
 * if a dialog appears that warns you about change of gestures and ask
   you whether you really want to turn VoiceOver on, answer
   affirmatively

=== Setting your language ===
In some non-English speaking countries, some iOS devices are shipped with English set as the default language. To set the user interface and VoiceOver voice for the proper language, follow these steps:

 * navigate to VoiceOver settings
 * open the "Language" item
 * navigate to the language you want to use your iOS device in
 * double-tap to select the language
 * navigate to the beginning of the screen and press the "Done" button

The user interface and VoiceOver voice will use the new language after
a few seconds.

=== Using Braille displays ===
iOS ships with out-of-the-box support of * braille displays. You can
see them listed <here>.

To setup your bluetooth Braille display, follow these instructions:

 * Turn your Braille display on
 * navigate to VoiceOver settings
 * open the "Braille" item
 * if bluetooth is off, iOS asks you if you want to turn it on - answer "Yes"
 * iOS is searching for bluetooth Braille displays and shows the found ones in the section "Choose a Braille Device"
 * once a desired display is found, select it in the list
 * enter the bluetooth PIN for your Braille device.  (Please be
   careful and enter it right, or you will have to restart your device
   to have a chance to enter the right PIN)
 * your bluetooth Braille display should now in a few seconds pair and
   work.

In case there is a problem during the setup of the connection, or
during usage, please see the Troubleshooting section on Braille displays.

== Preferences ==

=== Speaking rate ===
To have VoiceOver speak faster or slower:
 * navigate to VoiceOver settings
 * navigate to the "Speaking Rate" adjustable field (right after
   "Speaking Rate" heading)
 * flick up or down to increase or decrease speaking rate. The setting
   is in effect immediately

You might also prefer to be able to set the speaking rate directly in
the currenctly used app without having to go to VoiceOver settings to
change it back and forth.  To be able to do that,  navigate to the
"Include in Rotor" preference next to the "Speaking Rate" preference
and turn it on.  See TODO to learn how to use rotor to adjust
VoiceOver parameters directly in your application.

=== Language rotor ===
You should generally put into language rotor languages that you
understand and in which you might read content on your iOS device (be
it a foreign webpage, or an email from a person speaking that foreign
language).

To add a language to your rotor, follow these steps:

 * navigate to VoiceOver settings
 * navigate to Language Rotor
 * navigate to the language you want added to Language Rotor; ignore
   the reorder buttons
 * double-tap the language to add it to the rotor (unless you heard that it is
   "selected", in which case it is already in the rotor and you can
   remove it by double-tap)

Note that you do not have to add your default language to the rotor,
and we recommend you do not add it.

To learn how to use the Language Rotor, see TODO.
