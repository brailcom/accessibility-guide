The user does not need to install accessibility support on iOS devices
since it is preinstalled. That includes the VoiceOver screenreader,
voices for more than 30 languages, drivers for
[http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/braille-display.html
supported Bluetooth braille displays], input and output Braille tables
for supported languages, and the magnifier.

The disadvantage of this built-in approach is that if there is a bug in the built-in
accessibility infrastructure, or your language / Braille display is
not supported, you have to rely only on Apple to correct it. In such
case, contact [mailto:accessibility@apple.com accessibility@apple.com]
and let Apple know of your problems.
