== Device suddenly appears turned off and cannot be turned on == dead

This rarely happens from time to time. It was experienced both on a 4th
generation iPod Touch and on iPhone 4. The solution is to hold the home button
and the lock button simultaneously for approximately 10 seconds. The device
will then start booting and after a few seconds, it will work. If it does not,
then the cause of the problem is probably more severe and you should contact
authorized service.
