Among others, the three biggest platforms for desktop computers and laptops
are: GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X. For mobile devices,
the most important are Google's Android and Apple's iOS. It is not so easy to
recommend any one of them as they are quite different and offer qualities
in different areas. They have their advantages and deficiencies. Thus
we present all of them in the following three sections. Since many times
it might be useful to combine two or more different platforms for different
tasks, the last section of this chapter deals with combining platforms,
interoperability and virtualization.

== GNU/Linux ==

GNU/Linux is an environment largely based on the [http://www.gnu.org Free Software] development
model. It's very versatile, secure and comfortable. Most of its components are distributed free
of charge and thus accessible even to people with little financial resources. The way of being
able to install applications just by searching for their name, without a need to care about
their cost, DVDs or licensing, can be very convenient.

From the point of view of accessibility, a good thing about it is that many actions can also
be accomplished using a set of textual command line tools, which might be easier to handle
for a visually impaired user than graphical interfaces.

The various systems and tools in GNU/Linux are usually packed in distributions, such as Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora or others. The task of distributions is to put all the available pieces together
in a reasonable way. This guide largely deals with Ubuntu, but most of the information is valid
for other distributions as well.

=== Environments ===
Following are three big areas of the GNU/Linux platform, accessible for the blind
and visually handicapped, which can be of interest to you:

==== Gnome desktop ====

[http://www.gnome.org/about/ GNOME] offers an easy to understand modern desktop
environment for a GNU/Linux computer. Near to all the available applications can
be operated from this interface, regardless whether they provide a graphical,
textual or another form of interface.

The Gnome desktop is made accessible mainly through the Orca screen reader. Orca
includes modules for voice, braille and magnification.

==== Text console ====

Many applications and tools can also be operated from a purely textual
interface, although with some serious limitations. Some important things,
such as a modern internet browser, are not available in this environment.
Still it is a welcomed resort for many users in situations, when
they face some problems in the GNOME graphical desktop.

Although this is not crucial, a text console can be made fully
accessible (by voice and braille) using the following tools:
BrlTTY, eSpeakup and/or YASR.

==== Emacs ====

Emacs is a very interesting environment, because it can bring the advantages
of a consistent fully textual user interface operated primarily by keyboard
onto the modern graphical desktop. It can only contain its own applications,
but the very wide range of tasks that can be accomplished with it, from editing
text, through managing files and developing applications, to reading mail
and typesetting notes, make it a primary work environment for many, not just
the handicapped users.

Be aware however that you will find you have to learn some things first
and understand its concepts. The efficiency of your work afterwards should
however be enough of a reward.

Several tools are available to make it accessible, but we highly recommend
to use speechd-el.
