== Accessibility == accessibility

Accessibility is a property of an object that enables it to be operated by
people with physical impairment. The impairments can be visual
(e.g. blindness), aural (e.g. deafness), or motor (e.g. unability to use one's
hands). This guide focuses mainly on accessibility with respect to visual
impairments, especially blindness.

== Android == android

Android is a mobile [#os operating system] made by Google. It is used on mobile
phones and tablet computers by various manufacturers.

== Braille alphabet == braille-alphabet

Braille alphabet is a system for physical representation of text accessible for
the blind people. Each letter in this system is displayed in a separate
cell. Each cell has 8 dots. Each of these dots is either raised or not
raised. Different letters are then represented by raising a different
combination of dots within a cell.

== Braille display == braille-display

Braille display is an external computer device that displays information using
the [#braille-alphabet Braille alphabet]. The display is done by physical
dots on the braille display. The users then use their fingers to touch the
display and recognize the dots raised, and thus recognize the letters
displayed.

== chmod == chmod

/chmod/ is a [#unix Unix] command used to change settings of file
permissions. 'chmod +x' is often used in the context of this guide to
make a file executable after it was downloaded from the internet. See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chmod] for more details.

== sudo == sudo

/sudo/ is a GNU/Linux command used to, from a normal user account, execute an
action with superuser rights. For example to modify a file in a location which
otherwise is not accessible to your ordinary user accounts. Sudo can only be
used from user accounts with explicitly assigned rights for such administrative
tasks. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudo] for more details.

== Command line == command-line

Command line is a way of interacting with computer which uses only text. It is
popular mainly on [#unix Unix] [#os operating systems], because these have a
well designed command line.

== GNU/Linux == gnu-linux

GNU/Linux is a freely available [#unix Unix] [#os operating system]. For more
information on GNU/Linux, see [overview#gnu-linux its section in Overview].

== iOS == ios

iOS is a touchscreen mobile [#os operating system] made by Apple. For more
information on iOS, see [overview#ios its section in Overview].

== Mac OS X == macosx

Mac OS X is a [#unix Unix] [#os operating system] made by Apple. It can only be
used on Apple's computers. For more information on Mac OS X, see
[overview#macosx its section in Overview].

== Magnifier == magnifier

Magnifier is a program that makes computer accessible to people with non-severe
visual impairments, i.e. those who can see but not well. It makes objects on
the computer screen larger so that the user has no longer a problem to
recognize the object and its parts and interact with them.

== Operating system == os

Operating system is the basic software that is responsible for the elementary
functionality of your computer like start up, screen display, running several
programs at once etc. You can install additional programs on top of your
operating system to add functionality to your computer. Examples of an
operating system are [#windows], [#gnu-linux], [#macosx], [#android] or [#ios].

== Screen reader == screen-reader

Screen reader is a program that makes computer accessible to blind people or
people with severe visual impairments. It enables the user to navigate around
elements of program and reads the descriptions of elements using
[#speech-synthesis speech synthesis]. It can also display the description on a
[#braille-display Braille display]. Once the user navigates to the desired
element, he/she can interact with the element (e.g. press it, write text into
it, or examine its textual content).

== Speech synthesis == speech-synthesis

Speech synthesis is a process of computer generation of human-like speech from
text.

== Unix == unix

Unix is a category of [#os operating systems] that share common
characteristics, especially the way they can be operated from the
command-line. Unix operating systems include e.g. [#gnu-linux GNU/Linux],
[#macosx Mac OS X], and others.

== Windows == windows

Windows is a desktop [#os operating system] made by Microsoft. It is the most
widely used desktop operating system. For more information on Windows, see
[overview#windows its section in Overview].
