== chmod == chmod

/chmod/ is a GNU/Linux command used to change settings of file
permissions. 'chmod +x' is often used in the context of this guide to
make a file executable after it was downloaded from the internet. See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chmod] for more details.

== sudo == sudo

/sudo/ is a GNU/Linux command used to, from a normal user account, execute an
action with superuser rights. For example to modify a file in a location which
otherwise is not accessible to your ordinary user accounts. Sudo can only be
used from user accounts with explicitly assigned rights for such administrative
tasks. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sudo] for more details.
