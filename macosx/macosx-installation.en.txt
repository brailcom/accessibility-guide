== VoiceOver voices ==
Mac OS X ships only with American English voices (see bug
[https://boss.brailcom.org/its/issues/3437 #3437]). Even if you are an
English speaker, you might prefer a different voice than the one
shipped (e.g. a British English one). And if you are not an English speaker,
you will have to install and get voice for your language. Infovox iVox provides
voices for various languages. The price is 99 EUR/USD per voice. Just
download the 30-day trial installer with voice for your language from
[http://www.assistiveware.com/voicedownload.php this page] and if you
are satisfied, purchase the voice before the 30-day deadline passes.

== Braille input tables ==
Mac OS X ships only with American English Braille tables (see bug
[https://boss.brailcom.org/its/issues/3439 #3439]). So if you
are not an English speaker, you need to install Braille tables that
ensure the text in your language is properly displayed on your Braille
display.  Cecimac provides Braille tables for many languages.  You can
download the installer [http://www.cecimac.org/CeciMacBraille.dmg
here]. After installation is finished, you have to restart your
computer. After the restart, select the proper Braille table in
VoiceOver Utility in section "Braille" in the "Display" tab. You do
not have to have the same language for Mac OS X and the Braille table
selected, you can freely switch between tables in the VoiceOver
utility and it takes effect immediately, without restarting VoiceOver.
