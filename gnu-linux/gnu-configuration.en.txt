=== Orca === orca

Orca settings are available from the graphical user interface of the
application. So to change settings, start Orca or switch to its window and find
the "Settings" button. Here you can find settings for keyboard layout, speech,
braille magnification etc. Some key settings might require a restart of Orca.

=== Emacs + speechd-el === emacs

==== Configuration methods ==== emacs-conf-methods

There are several ways to change settings in Emacs and speechd-el. You can
change settings temporarily or permanently. You can also have different
settings for different parts of Emacs.

===== via Emacs command =====

Temporary settings, such as a momentary change of voice rate or punctuation
level can be done using an Emacs command, which you can insert after pressing
Meta-x, or using a keyboard shortcut. Below are a couple of examples

Set voice: Meta-x speechd-set-voice /or/ CTRL-e d v
Set voice rate: Meta-x speechd-set-rate /or/ CTRL-e d r
Set punctuation mode: Meta-x speechd-set-punctuation-mode /or/ CTRL-e d .

You can find a complete list of available speechd-el commands
in the [http://cvs.freebsoft.org/doc/speechd-el/speechd-el_8.html#SEC12 speechd-el manual, section settings]

===== via customize-group =====

All speechd-el settings are available from the Emacs customization
interface under the group name 'speechd-el'. You can access it by pressing
'Meta-x customize-group ENTER speechd-el'. Each setting can be changed
either just for the given session, or saved permanently. Permanent setting
means write it into the ~/.emacs configuration file, which is described below.

All available options and groups of options are accompanied by their
full descriptions.

===== via ~/.emacs config file =====

Permanent settings are stored in the ~/.emacs configuration file
in the Emacs Lisp syntax. All available options are described in
[http://cvs.freebsoft.org/doc/speechd-el/speechd-el_9.html#SEC15
speechd-el documentation, section Customization].

==== Initial setup ==== brltty

In order to start speechd-el automatically when Emacs starts, place the
following commands at the end of your ~/.emacs file:

-----
(autoload 'speechd-speak "speechd-speak" nil t)
-----

=== BrlTTY === brltty

BrlTTY stores its configuration in a text configuration file, which is
often placed in '\/etc/brltty.conf', but might be available at a different
location depending on your Linux distribution.

After changing the configuration settings, you must restart BrlTTY.

-----
/etc/init.d/brltty restart
-----

==== Initial setup ==== brltty-initial-setup

Usually, it is needed to at least set BrlTTY for the correct braille
device. Edit the configuration file as follows

 1. Search for series of lines beginning with 'braille-driver' and uncomment
 (remove the '#' hash sign) from the one that describes your driver.

 2. Search for 'text-table' and uncomment the one that describes your preferred
 language

 3. Search for braille-device, uncomment the correct line and if necessary, set
 address to the device according to the provided template

Take this example (Czech table, Baum USB device). The only uncommented lines
(not starting with the hash sign) will be:
-----
braille-driver  bm      # Baum
text-table      cs      # Czech
braille-device  usb:    # First USB device matching braille driver.
-----

For British English table, Freedom Scientific device with MAC address
12:2F:22:21:A2:11
-----
braille-driver  fs      # FreedomScientific
text-table      en_UK   # British English
braille-device bluetooth:12:2F:22:21:A2:11 # Specific bluetooth device by address.
-----

=== Speech Dispatcher === speech-dispatcher

Most often, you should not need to change the configuration
of Speech Dispatcher at all. Most settings, such as voice
selection or voice rate, can be influenced directly from
the client application (e.g. Orca or Emacs). There are however
some special cases where you need to change the configuration
of the server directly.

Speech Dispatcher stores its configuration in a text configuration
file. It is stored in \/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf or similar
location. If your distribution runs Speech Dispatcher as a user
service (in Ubuntu, this is the default), you can also override
the configuration options on per-user basis in
~/.speech-dispatcher/conf/speechd.conf .

The most common configuration options can be conveniently
changed using the command line setup tool spd-conf

:User configuration: spd-conf
:System configuration: sudo spd-conf

After changing the configuration settings, you must reload or restart Speech
Dispatcher

-----
killall speech-dispatcher
-----

==== Initial setup ==== speech-dispatcher-initial-setup

Only if you want to use a different output module or audio subsystem
than is offered as preconfigured, you might need the following two steps.
The recommended way to set them is using the 'spd-conf' command line tool.

-----
spd-conf
-----

Most often, you will want to setup an entirely new configuration as the 'user'
configuration.

Bellow is described how to make the changes manually.

 * Set output module

Not all supported TTS systems are enabled by default. E.g. in Ubuntu,
,,espeak'' and ,,festival'' might be offered on fresh instalations, but
to enable modules like ,,flite'', ,,ivona'' or ,,ibmtts'', you need to
uncomment the appropriate AddModule line in speechd.conf.

In \/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf search for the AddModule line
whose first parameter is the name of the module you want to enable.
Then remove the '#' character from the beginning of the line if there
is one.

 * Set audio device

By default, Speech Dispatcher will output sound to Pulse Audio
and most often, this is the correct and most convenient option.
If however your system does not use Pulse Audio, you will hear
no sound. In such a case, you need to change the AudioOutputMethod
line in \/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf (and remove the '#'
character from the beginning of the line if there is any).

For example to set audio output to ALSA, use:
-----
AudioOutputMethod "alsa"
-----

=== Festival === festival

Festival configuration can be adjusted using a scheme configuration file
\/etc/festival.scm or in similar location.  This is however rarely needed
except in conjunction with instalation of new voices or if you want to override
some defaults of the speech synthesis process.

=== eSpeak === espeak

eSpeak itself doesn't provide any kind of permanent configuration and there is
usually no need for any.

== Applications == applications

=== Firefox === firefox

There are two basic kinds of settings for Firefox. The settings of the
application itself and settings of Orca, the screen reader. Additionally,
Firefox can also remember permission settings specific for a given webpage.

*Firefox settings* can be accessed from the main menu, item Edit, subitem
 Settings.

*Orca settings for Firefox* can be open with >>Orca+Ctrl+<<Space from
inside Firefox, then move to card 'Firefox' using arrow keys.

*Permission settings for a page* can be accessed by opening the given
page, pressing Ctrl-I to bring up the 'Information about page' dialog,
then arrow keys to get to the 'Permissions' card. TAB will cycle
between the items (Allow popup window, Save cookies etc.).

==== Recommendation ==== firefox-recommendation

In Orca settings for Firefox (>>Orca+Ctrl+<<Space while in Firefox), get
to card Firefox and set 'Grab focus on object when navigating' to off.

=== Thunderbird === thunderbird

Thunderbird preferences can be accessed from the main menu, item
'Edit', subitem 'Preferences'. These are the general settings
of the application.

Account settings can be opened on every account, see main menu 'Edit',
subitem 'Account settings'.

The default layout is controlled from the main menu, item 'View'.

==== Recommendation ==== thunderbird-recommendation

Switch off the message pane in main menu item View, subitem Layout or by
pressing F8. If not, every message you go through when navigating through the
list of messages by pressing up and down keys will be downloaded, displayed and
marked as read.

==== OpenOffice.org ==== openoffice

==== OpenOffice Writer Shortcuts ==== openoffice-writer-shortcuts

OpenOffice has a very useful command to select the text in the current
paragraph (exactly). This command, like quite a few others, is just not mapped
to any keyboard shortcut. This can be done from main menu
'Tools->Customize'. This will bring up a dialog with several cards
(tabs). Keyboard shortcuts can be re-defined on card 'Keyboard' (use
>>Ctrl+PgUp<< and >>Ctrl+PgDown<< to browse them). You can browse the list of
available keyboard shortcuts as well as define new ones.

To define the keyboard shortcut for 'Select paragraph':
 1) Go to the 'Keyboard' card in the Customize dialog
 2) Select the desired key combination (recommended is >>Ctrl+Shift+s<<)
 3) Press >>TAB<< repeatedly to get into the 'Category' tree
 4) Select 'Edit' with Up and Down arrow keys
 5) Press >>TAB<< to go to the 'Function' tree
 6) Select 'Select paragraph' using Up and Down keys
 7) Press >>TAB<< repeatedly to find the 'Modify' button and press it
 8) Now >>Ctrl+Shift+s<< is defined as a new shortcut, close the dialog with the OK button
