= Instalation of BrlTTY on Ubuntu =

This applies to *Ubuntu Lucid* and *Maverick*. If you have an older version of Ubuntu, we highly recommend to upgrade first.

== Step 1: Package installation ==

First, we need to download and install the BrlTTY package. This
can be done in the graphical user interface or on the command line
as follows:

:Ubuntu UI: In [gnu-installation#synaptic Synaptic package manager], install brltty
:Ubuntu Command: sudo apt-get install brltty

== Step 2: Get configuration file ==

In Ubuntu 10.10, the BrlTTY package does not contain a configuration file [[https://its.freebsoft.org/its/issues/3145 bug #3145]].
Normally, the preferred way to create it would be by running the 'brltty-setup'
command. This however doesn't work in Ubuntu 10.10.

What needs to be done is to download the [brltty.conf brltty.conf configuration file]
and copy it into \/etc/brltty.conf . It can be accomplished by the
following commands:

-----
wget http://live.freebsoft.org/ubuntu-brltty/attachments/brltty.conf -O /tmp/brltty.conf
sudo cp /tmp/brltty.conf /etc/brltty.conf
-----

== Step 3: Configuration ==

Now you need to [gnu-configuration#brltty configure BrlTTY]
