= Installation of Festival on Ubuntu =

This applies to *Ubuntu Lucid* and *Maverick*. If you have an older version of
Ubuntu, we highly recommend to upgrade first.

== Step 1: Packages installation ==

First, we need to download and install the necessary packages. This
can be done in the graphical user interface or on the command line
as follows:

:Ubuntu UI: In [gnu-installation#synaptic Synaptic package manager], install festival *and* festival-freebsoft-utils
:Ubuntu Command: sudo apt-get install festival festival-freebsoft-utils

== Step 2: Launch script ==

In Ubuntu, the Festival package does not contain a launch script
[[https://its.freebsoft.org/its/issues/3143 bug #3143]]. Thus if you
are happy to launch Festival manually each time you want to use it by
typing the 'festival --server' command, you can skip this step. This
is however quite inconvenient, so we suggest to:

Download the [festival.init init script],
copy it into \/etc/init.d/festival and make it executable. It can be accomplished by the
following commands.

-----
wget http://live.freebsoft.org/ubuntu-festival/attachments/festival.init -O /tmp/festival.init
sudo mv /tmp/festival.init /etc/init.d/festival
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/festival
-----

The script needs to be enabled using a [festival.default default file] this way:

-----
wget http://live.freebsoft.org/ubuntu-festival/attachments/festival.default -O /tmp/festival.default
sudo mv /tmp/festival.default /etc/default/festival
-----

Then you have to obtain a Festival configuration file:

-----
sudo wget http://live.freebsoft.org/ubuntu-festival/attachments/festival.scm -O /etc/festival.scm
-----

Finally the script then needs to be linked to the startup process and started:

-----
sudo update-rc.d festival defaults
sudo /etc/init.d/festival start
-----

== Step 3: Install voices and add-ons ==

Your Festival should be installed and running by now. You might
however want to install some additional voices or sound libraries.
