== Restart Orca et al in GNOME ==

If you experience a problem with Orca like freezing, it's best to restart the
whole GNOME accessibility infrastructure. We provide a script 'a11y-restart'
which can do that for you. You can manually download [a11y-restart
a11y-restart] and place it as an executable into an appropriate location
(e.g. \/usr/local/bin), using the following commands:

-----
wget http://live.freebsoft.org/troubleshooting/attachments/a11y-restart -O /tmp/a11y-restart
sudo cp /tmp/a11y-restart /usr/local/bin/a11y-restart
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/a11y-restart
-----

To make it easier to launch the script, create a keyboard shortcut: go to
System > Preferences > Keyboard shortcut, in that dialog click the "Add" button
and in the dialog that appears, enter e.g. "Restart Orca" as Name and
a11y-restart as Command. Then click Apply and find the just added shortcut by
name in the table of Actions. When you are there, edit its shortcut by clicking
the "Shortcut" column and then entering a keyboard shortcut of your choice by
pressing it. Finally close the dialog.

Now you can try the shortcut you entered. It will restart Orca and its support
infrastructure whenever you press the shortcut.

If you experience a very hard freeze that makes the graphical interface
unresponsive to the point that even the keyboard shortcut you registered cannot
be pressed, go to the text console by CTRL+ALT+F1, and there login and start
the script manually by typing a11y-restart (hint: it usually suffices to type
the 2 letters "a1" and then hit TAB and then ENTER). Then, get back to the
graphical desktop and press the keyboard shortcut to restart Orca.
