== General principles ==

=== Main menu ===

Each appliction has a main menu. The main menu usually gives access to
most functions that can be used in the application, as well as to the
application settings and help.

You can access the menu with F10, move in the menu with arrow keys and
select with ENTER. The left and right keys select among the items in
the top level menu (such as File, Edit, Tools, Help). Up and Down keys
select among items in submenus (such as Open, Save, Save As,
Close). Sometimes an item in a submenu itself has a submenu. Then
pressing the Right key once will open the submenu and again, you can
move in it by up and down keys. Pressing the Left key will close the
submenu, while pressing the Right key again will skip to another item
in the top level menu.

Shortcuts:
:F10: Go to application main menu
:Up or Down: Choose from submenu
:Right: Next item in top-level menu or open submenu if any
:Left: Previous item in top-level menu or close submenu (if open)

=== Context menu ===

Context menu is not associated with the application as such, but with
a particular object in the application. Object can be a file, an edit
field, an song, a piece of text, a link in the internet browser or a
contact in the instant messagener. Context menu is opened on the given
object and it offers actions that can be done with it.

Usually, pressing ENTER on the object will perform the default action,
but there are usually many more accessible through Shift-F10.

Examples:
 * To compress a folder into a .zip archive, find the folder in the File browser,
open its context menu, then choose 'Archive...' from the context menu.
 * To check the size of an image, find the image, open its context menu, then choose Properties.
 * To open a link in the web browser in a new window instead of the existing window,
find the link, then chose 'Open in new window' from the context menu.

Shortcuts:
:Shift-F10: Open context menu

=== Keyboard shortcuts logic ===

:CTRL-combination: Combinations with CTRL key trigger various actions (e.g. CTRL-u undo)
:ALT-combination: Combinations with ALT key are used for menu access and manipulating with application windows
:SHIFT-combination: SHIFT is often used to reverse an action (e.g. CTRL-u --Undo, SHIFT-CTRL-u -- Redo)

=== Orca screen reader ===

Orca offers two default layouts for keyboard navigation. The only
difference between them that the desktop layout makes use of the
numerical block on keyboard, but the laptop layout has to deal without
it.

Most important difference is in the use of base key for many Orca
shortcuts, usually called the Orca key:

:Orca key in Deskto mode: INSERT
:Orca key in Laptop mode: Caps Lock

==== General ====

:Orca+Space: Launch the Orca Configuration dialog.
:Orca+S: Toggle speech on and off.
:Orca+Q: Quit Orca.

==== Flat review ====

In desktop mode, flat review keys are located in the numerical
keypad block. Since many laptops do not have a separete, numerical
keypad, the shortcuts are different for laptop layout and they use
the Orca key together with the keyboard segment between keys 7, 9, dot
and coma.

:Numpad-minus (Orca+P): Toogle between flat review and cursor tracking

Reading by lines:
:Numpad-7 (Orca+U): Previous line -- Move the flat review cursor to the previous line and read it.
:Numpad-8 (Orca+I): This line -- Read the current line.
:Numpad-9 (Orca+O): Next line -- Move the flat review cursor to the next line and read it.

Reading by words:
:Numpad-4 (Orca+J): Previous word -- Move the flat review cursor to the previous word and read it.
:Numpad-5 (Orca+K): This word -- Read the current word.
:Numpad-6 (Orca+L): Next word -- Move the flat review cursor to the next word and read it.

Reading by characters:
:Numpad-1 (Orca+M): Previous character -- Move the flat review cursor to the previous character and read it.
:Numpad-2 (Orca+coma): This character -- Read the current character.
:Numpad-3 (Orca+period): Next character -- Move the flat review cursor to the next character and read it.

Mouse clicks at location of the flat-review cursor:
:Numpad-slash (Orca+7): Left mouse click
:Numpad-star (Orca+8): Right mouse click

Other:
:Numpad+Plus: Read all -- reads from the current position of the caret to the end of the document.
:Numpad+Enter: Where am I -- Speaks information such as the title of the current application window, as well as the name of the control that currently has focus.

==== Tables ====

:Orca+F11: Rows or cells -- Toggle the reading of tables, either by single cell or whole row.

==== Learn mode ====

To examine the functions of various keys and keyboard shortcuts in the
given situation, you can always enter the learn mode with Orca-H.  In
the learn mode, you can press any key or keyboard shortcut and it will
announce its name and tell what it would be supposed to do, but
doesn't actually do anything (except for Escape which exits the learn
mode).

Be aware however that Orca only announces functions of keyboard
combinations that belong to it. Many useful combinations are
provided by the application itself and you can't discover them this
way.

Shortcuts:
:Orca+H: Enter into Orca's ``learn mode''
:ESC: Exit from ``learn mode''

==== Advanced ====

:Orca+F: Speak font and attribute information for the current character.

=== Login and Logout ===

To start your computer and login:

 1) Power the computer on.
 2) Wait a minute or two until you hear a 'drums' sound.
 3) Press ENTER to choose the last logged in user, then type your password, confirm with ENTER.
 4) If your login is successful you will hear the login melody. If not, repeat.

Be aware that repeated failures to login, if you have more users defined in the system,
might be due to the fact that you are choosing an incorrect user by pressing
the first ENTER. In such a case, you might need sighted help.

To shut down the computer:

 1) Press CTRL-ALT-DELETE, a new 'Shutdown computer' dialog will appear in a separate window.
 2) In case the dialog doesn't have focus, cycle through the available windows with ALT-TAB to find it.
 3) Choose whether you want to shutdown the computer, hibernate, put in sleep mode or restart.

Shortcuts:
:CTRL-ALT-DELETE: Bring up the 'Shutdown computer' dialog

=== Main menu ===

From the main menu, you can launch applications, access directories on your dissk or system settings.
To get to the menu, press ALT-F1. To move between the items, use the arrow keys.

== Reading mail ==

=== Thunderbird ===

==== Setup account ====

To setup a new mail account:

 1) Go to the main application menu using F10 and down key
 2) Under the menu item File, select 'New', press right arrow to open the submenu
 3) Select Mail account
 4) Fill in your full name, email address and password for the account, choose Continue
 5) Thunderbird will try to guess the other details. This however often doesn't work, so it is
perhaps a good ide to go find the Manual settings... button. And check the details in the
account settings dialog. (Note that this button will only appear after the autodiscovery finishes)
 6) The settings for your outgoing (SMTP) mail server can be found in the same dialog window, but
under different card. Move back to the list of available cards by pressing F6 and move using up and
down arrows.

==== Subscribe IMAP folders ====

If have an IMAP account (which we highly recommend), you first need
to subscribe all the folders you want to receive.

 1) Go to the main application menu using F10 and down key
 2) Under File, choose Subscribe folders...
 3) In the dialog window that opens you can find a dropdown menu of items and related
to it a list of folders available for each account under "Folder List".
 4) Next to each folder in the list is a checkbox, in Ubuntu Maverick and
perhaps elsewhere it is however not acessible [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=620915 bug #620915].
 5) Even without sighted help, you can browse the collapsable tree
of folders and choosing whether to subscribe or unsubscribe them using
the 'Subscribe' and 'Unsubscribe' buttons. You however can't see the current
state.
 6) To subscribe all folders, push Subscribe while on the top level item
(usually 'INBOX' or similar').

==== Read messages ====

The main Thunderbird window has by default three areas (panes):
    1. List of accounts and folders (such as Inbox, Sent, Drafts...)
    2. List of mails in the selected folder
    3. Contents of the selected email
You can cycle between these three panes using F6 forward and SHIFT-F6
backward. Thus pressing F6 on a folder will bring you to the list of
emails and pressing F6 on an email will take you to see what's written
in it.

To examine the contents of an email line by line, simply press up
and down arrow keys. Flat review, on the other hand, is not available
here.

CTRL-R will create a new message as a reply to the sender, CTRL-SHIFT-R
is Reply to all.

There is of course more things you can do with the message. A full list
of them you can find in the 'Message' item of the main menu (access it through
F10 and down key, then use right arrow key to find it)

==== Write a message ====

The new message dialog has 4 areas which you can cycle through using F6:
 1. From -- your account selection
 2. Addresses -- Fields for To, Copy, Blank copy etc.
 3. Subject
 4. Text

To write a new message:
 1. Press CTRL-N to start new message
 2. The focus is on the address field. Once you start typing the email address or
    the name of the recipient (TO:), you can press the down arrow and choose from the offered
     completions.
 3. Pressing ENTER creates another address field. You can type another recipients
    address or pres SHIFT-TAB and choose other kind of delivery (CC: -- copy,
    BCC: -- blind copy), then come back to the address input with TAB. The
    address area is actually a table of selections of delivery methods and
    corresponding addresses. You can create as many entries as necessary.
 4. When finished with addresses, press F6 to go to the Subject field
 5. Then press F6 to go to the text field and write the email text.
 6. If you want to add an attachment, you can do so from the main menu (F10 and down).
    Under 'File' find 'Attach', press right arrow key to open submenu, choose 'File'.
 7. To send the message, press CTRL-ENTER
 8. To save the message as a draft, go to the main menu, under 'File' choose 'Save as', then 'Draft'

==== Unread folders and messages ====

:Display unread messages only: Alt-v e u or menu-View-Threads-Unread
:Display all messages: Alt-v e a or menu-View-Threads-All

:Display folders with unread messages only: Alt-v f u or menu-View-Folders-Unread
:Display all folders: Alt-v f a or menu-View-Folders-All

==== Sort messages ====

To sort messages using one of the available fields, select View item
in the main menu, then open the subitem 'Sort by' using right arrow
key.  From the submenu, choose on of the offered fields (Date,
Subject, Received...) using ENTER. Come again to the same submenu to
choose whether the sort should be asceding or descending.


==== Search for messages ====

 1. In the folder selection pane, choose the folder you want to search
 2. Press CTR-F to move focus to the Search input field
 3. Type the text you want to search for
 4. By default, the text is searched in the 'From' field. There are buttons bellow this
    input field to search the text also in the 'To' field, in message text or others. They
    are however not accessible in Ubuntu Maverick.

For a more advanced Search, use CTRL-SHIFT-F or find 'Edit', 'Find' then 'Search messages'
in the main menu (F10 and down)

=== Gnus ===


== Browsing web ==

=== Firefox ===

==== Navigation between pages ====

:Ctrl-l: Enter a new location (URL or search term)
:Alt-LeftArrow: Go to previous visited page
:Alt-RightArrow: Go to next visited page

To visit a page:

 1) Press Ctrl-l (location) to enter the address bar
 2) You can either type direcly the URL of the page you want to see
    or just a series of words. If you type only words, Google will
    search for them and a webpage will display with the search results.

If you are interested in having more pages open at the same time and
switch between them, see [#tabbed-browsing].

==== Navigation inside a page ====

You can read a page line by line using the up and down arrow keys. It
is however often more convenient to read through bigger sections or
search just for the part that you are interested. Bellow is a list of
the most common keyboard shortcuts with Orca:

Basic navigation:
:Down arrow: Next line (Up arrow previous line)
:Ctrl+Home or End: Go to top or bottom of the document

Landmark navigation:
:m: Next landmark (Shift-m previous)

Navigation over page items:
:h: Next heading (Shift-1 previous)
:1 or 2,3,4,5,6: Next heading of the given level (Shift-1 or 2,3,4,5,6 previous)
:p: Next paragraph (Shift-p previous)
:i: Next list item (Shift-i previous)
:o: Next large object (Shift-o previous)
:r: Next live region (Shift-r previous)
:t: Next table (Shift-t previous)
:u or v: Next unvisited or visited link (Shift-u or v previous)

Others:
:ctrl+left/right: goto previous/next word
:Orca+left/right: goto previous/next object

Orca mode settings:
:Orca-F12: Toggle between orca navigation and Firefox navigation
:Orca+z: Toggle structural navigation

==== Tables ====

:t: Next table (Shift-t previous)
:Shift+Alt+Arrow: Jump to table cell in given arrow direction (Up, Down, Left, Right)
:Shift+Alt+Home or End: Jump to first or last cell in the table

==== Forms ====

:e: Next input field
:b: Next button
:Orca-Tab: Go to the next form field (Orca-Shift-Tab previous)
:Alt+Down: Expand combo box(left alt)

==== Access keys ====

Access keys often provide useful functionality, such as jump to page
content or jump to menu. There is however no standard definition for
them and thus they might be different in different web applications.

:SHIFT-ALT-key: Execute action defined for 'key'

==== Live regions ====

:r: Next live region (Shift-r previous)
:\: Advance the politeness level for the current live region
:Shift+\: Set all live regions on page to politeness of 'off'

:Orca+F1 or F2 to F9: Review previously announced live region messages (F1 most recent, F2 last most recent etc.)

==== Tabbed browsing ==== tabbed-browsing

It is possible to keep multiple pages open inside the Firefox
window and switch between them as necessary. Only one of them is
visible at once, but the other ones also stay open, they are merely
hidden visually, and you can bring them up at any time.

To follow a link on the webpage, you have two options.  Pressing ENTER
on that link will replace the current page with the new page. Pressing
Ctrl-ENTER however will keep the current page, keep your focus there
and open your new page in another tab which you can examine later.

To open a new webpage, Ctrl-L will take you to the location bar when
you can type a new address and it will replace the page that you are
currently reading. Ctrl-T however will keep your page open, create
a new tab and bring you to it's location bar. You can then read
another page without having to close to the former one, to which
you can return later.

To move between the tabs, use Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDown.

Shortcuts:
:Ctrl-Enter: Open link in new tab
:Ctrl-T: Open new tab and place focus in its location bar
:Ctrl-W: Close the current tab
:Ctrl-PgUp: Move to previous tab
:Ctrl-PgDown: Move to the next tab
:Alt-number: Move to the tab with the given numer (Alt-1 first tab, Alt-2 second tab etc.)

==== Bookmarks ====

You can create bookmarks on pages that you visit often
or pages that you want to visit later.

To create a bookmark on a page, open the page, then press Ctrl-D.
This will open the bookmark dialog, where you can edit its title,
then press the Save button.

The Bookmarks are stored in the main menu. Access it using F10,
press right arrow key repeatedly to find the 'Bookmarks' item
and browse your bookmarks with up/down arrow keys. Pressing
Enter on any of them will open the associated page in your
current window.

If you want to do some other action with the selected bookmark, such
as open it in a new tab or to delete it, press Shift-F10
to open the context menu and choose the action you would
like with up and down keys.

You can also group your bookmarks in folders, just see the other edit
fields and menu items.

Shortcuts:
:Ctrl-D: Bookmark this page

==== Full keyboard shortcuts reference for Firefox ====

 * Orca mode for Firefox: [http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Firefox] (incomplete)
 * Firefox itself: [http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/keyboard]

The complete list of Orca mode keyboard shortcuts you can find in the Orca
settings dialog for Firefox. While in Firefox, press Orca-Ctrl-Space,
then use ALT-PgUP or Alt-PgDown to find the Keyboard shortcuts tab.

== Managing files ==

=== Nautilus ===

Nautilus is the default file browser in Gnome. It has a menu, a
location bar displaying the current address and two panes (areas).

The left pane, by default, displays Places -- disks on your system,
external drives, your camera, network folders. It also contains
bookmarks to some common destinations like your home directory or your
Documents directory.  The pane can be switched to display other things
also, like history of your browsing.

The right pane is used to browse the files and folders and perform
actions on them.

The location bar is similar to the address field in a web browser.  It
shows where you currently are but it also allows you to write or paste
a concrete location in your system.

==== Launching Nautilus ====

 1) Go to the main menu by pressing ALT-F1 anywhere on the desktop
 2) Using right arrow, move to the main item ``Places''
 3) Using down arrow, choose the place (disk, device or bookmark)
 4) Press ENTER to launch Nautilus at the selected place

==== Browsing files ====

The browse pane of Nautilus can work in two modes, Icon view and list
view. You can switch between them by pressing CTRL-1 and CTRL-2
anywhere in the application. We recommend to switch to list view
(Ctrl-2). Nautilus will remember this and use this view also next
time.

In list view (Ctrl-2), you can browse the directory structure like a
tree menu by UP and DOWN keys, while you enter deeper into directories
or return back from them by RIGHT and LEFT keys.

In icon view (Ctrl-1), you can browse files with all the arrow keys
and you must press ALT-UP and ALT-DOWN to go up and down in the
directory hierarchy.

Use the F6 key to cycle between the file list, the location bar and
the Places pane (or SHIFT-F6 to cycle backwards).

For example to find a directory 'photo/norwegia' on an external device
called 'Camera':

 0) Switch to list view using CTRL-2 if you have not already done so
 1) Go to the Places pane using SHIFT-F6
 2) Use up/down keys to choose the 'Camera' device
 3) Press F6 to go back to file browser
 4) Use up/down keys to find the 'photo' folder, press ENTER on it
 5) No wuse up/down keys to find the 'norwegia folder
 6) You can enter the folder by pressing ENTER or do some other action
    with it by openning the context menu using SHIFT-F10

==== Copying files ====

 1) Find the file or directory you want to copy
 2) Press CTRL-C on it (or CTRL-X if you want to move)
 3) Go into the directory you want to place it in
 4) Press CTRL-V

==== Operations with files and folders ====

If you want to delete, rename or make a .zip archive from a file or folder:

 1) Find the file or folder you want to do something with
 2) Launch the context menu using SHIFT-F10
 3) Choose the action which you want to do (delete, rename, archive...)

==== Connecting and disconnecting external devices ====

External devices are usually connected automatically when you plug the
cables or the card into the reader. When you finish working with them
however, you can't just plug the cable out as that could result in
loss of data. Thus you need to tell the system to disconnect the device first:

 1) In the 'Places' pane (get to it through F6)
 2) Choose the device you want to disconnect
 3) Open the context menu using SHIFT-F10
 4) From the available actions, select 'Disconnect'

==== Shortcuts overview ====

:Ctrl-1: Icon view
:Ctrl-2: List view
:F6: Move between locations and directory listing
:ALT-HOME: Return to home directory
:Ctrl-H: Move cursor to location bar
:SHIFT-F10: Open context menu. If open on files or folders, lists actions available on them (like copy, rename etc.)
:CTRL-H: Show/hide hidden files
:F2: Rename
:DEL: Move into trash
:SHIFT-DEL: Delete immediatelly (irreversible)

=== Command line ===

Many times, it can be more convenient to use textual commands and
manipulate files on the command line. One must have a basic knowledge
of the commands that are available, but for details, he can always
consult the embedded help. It is not even necessary to type much as
the shell can complete commands and names of files automatically once
you type the first few letters.

Shortcuts:
:CTRL-ALT-t" Launch terminal
:TAB: Complete a command, parameter or filename or list available options if more than one

==== Basic file manipulation ====

:ls: list contents of a folder
:cp file location: Copy file (also folder) to location (filename or folder)
:mv file location: Move file (also folder) to location (filename or folder)
:rm file: Permanently remove a file
:mkdir folder_name: Create a folder (it is a shortcut for 'make directory')

This section is here just to explain the basic idea and show that this
way of work can be actually quite easy and fast. For a more complete
guide, see TODO: link


==== Example ====

To move a file 'ubuntu-accessibility.txt' from folder '/home/joe/' into a new folder '/home/joe/notes',

 1. cd (change directory to the home folder)
 2. ls (see the contents of the directory if you wish)
 3. mkdir notes (create a new directory 'notes')
 4. mv ubun
 5. Press TAB to complete, you should now see: 'mv ubuntu-accessibility.txt '
 6. Type notes
 7. Now you have 'mv ubuntu-accessibility.txt notes', press ENTER
 8. Type 'ls notes' and ENTER to verify that the file is in there

To copy all .txt files into a folder 'documents':
 * cp *.txt documents ENTER
or just
 * cp *.txt docu TAB ENTER

== Creating documents ==

Various documents (such as papers, letter, spreadsheets or
presentation) can be created with the Openoffice.Org package.

To launch OpenOffice, press Alt-F2, then type 'openoffice.org'

There are several different components inside OpenOffice
that can be used for different tasks. These are:

:Openoffice Writer: Word processor (documents, letters etc.)
:Openoffice Calc: Table calculator (spreadsheets)
:Openoffice Presenter: Conference style presentations

When you launch OpenOffice, it will offer various options what to
create, as well as the possibility to open a file.  Based on your
decision, the appropriate application will open.

=== Openoffice Writer ===

Writer is a word processor that can be used to read or create
documents, letters etc.

The default view includes four main components which you can browse
using F6 and SHIFT-F6:
 1. the main menu -- near to all actions are available from main menu
 2. standard tools -- most common tools and actions (such as save, open,
    print, create table etc.)
 3. formatting tools -- formatting (such as text style, font, size,
    paragraph aligment etc.)
 4. document edit box -- the contents of the document

==== Creating a simple document ====

This is just an example, we will create a document with a heading and
a paragraph.

 0. Open Openoffice.Org, choose 'Text document'
 1. This will start the application with an empty document, cursor
    placed into the edit box
 2. Write a text for the heading, for example 'My Story'
 3. Press Ctrl-1 to assign the current paragraph the 'Heading 1' style
 4. Start a new line (move to end of the first one using END key and press ENTER)
 5. Type the text of the first paragraph of your story, do not split lines
    using ENTER. Lines are wrapped automatically, ENTER serves to create
    new paragraphs.
 6. Press Ctrl-S to save the document using the standard Save dialog

==== Review of formatting ====

You can review the formatting of the document by using the Orca-f
keyboard shortcut in different places in the document. It will
announce font family and size of the current letter, but also
OpenOffice style (if any) for the given word (such as 'Normal text' or
'Heading 2').

==== Movement ====

:Right, Left: Move by characters
:Ctrl-Right, Ctrl-Left: Move by words
:Up, Down: Move by lines
:Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down: Move by paragraphs

:HOME, END: Move to beginning or end of line
:Ctrl-HOME, Ctrl-END: Move to beginning or end of document

==== Selections ==== openoffice-selections

:Ctrl-Shift-s: Select current paragraph (Note: This is a [configuration#openoffice-shortcuts custom shortcut], you need to define it first.)
:Ctrl-Shift-Down: Select till the end of paragraph
:Ctrl-A: Select all -- everything in the whole document
:Shift-END: Select till the end of line

==== Text style, paragraph aligment and fonts ====

Simple style and formatting changes are best done using shortcuts:

:Ctrl-0: Change current paragraph to normal text
:Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-5: Change current paragraph to heading 1 (biggest) to 5 (smallest)

:Ctrl-L: Align current paragraph left
:Ctrl-R: Align current paragraph right
:Ctrl-J: Justify current paragraph into block

To apply font properties, you must first select a piece of text you
want to apply them to. See [#openoffice-selections]. Otherwise they
will get applied to all text you will type later.

:Ctrl-B: Toogle 'bold' property on selected text on and off
:Ctrl-I: Toogle 'italics' property on selected text on and off
:Ctrl-U: Toogle 'underline' property on selected text on and off

To access all other formatting options (such as size of text, line
spacing or font family), press Shift-F10 to bring up the context menu
on the selected text. Browse it using the arrow keys and select with
ENTER.

==== Create a table ====

Go to main menu (F10) and select Table->Insert->Table . This will
bring up an Insert table dialog. Choose name for the table and its
size. ENTER will confirm the dialog and insert the table in your
document. You can enter it using arrow keys as well as move among its
cells.

To include a row or column, or delete a row or column, use the
context menu (Shift-F10) while inside one of the tables cells.

==== Spell checking ====

To be able to use spell checking, it is necessary to first set a correct language
for the document. This can be done in main menu, Tools->Language->For all text...
Spell checking for the whole document can be started by pressing F7.

On every error the spell checker finds, a dialog window will appear. The dialog
displays the part of the sentence where the error was found, a list of suggested
corrections and several action buttons (Change, Ignore, Add to dictionary). When
the dialog appears, the Change button is focused.

To examine the text that is supposed to contain a mistake and the proposed variants,
use SHIFT-TAB to move up to see the two areas.

 * If the word is actually correct in the given language, use Add to add it
to the dictionary
 * If you want to ignore this warning, use Ignore button
 * To correct by choosing from the offered alternatives, choose the desired one and press ENTER
 * To correct the mistake in another way, go to the window that displays the suspicious text,
   make any changes, use TAB to come back to the Change button and then press ENTER

If another possible mistake is found, another window will appear. At
the end, a window will appear to say that the spell check is
complete. Close it by pressing the OK button. This will take you back
to the document edit box.

=== Openoffice Presenter ===

We are not going to cover work with presentations in this basic
guide. It is however possible to create presentations without sight
and there are special ways how to give the presentations (the
challenge of course is to access what is displayed on the big screen
without disturbing the picture for the viewers).
