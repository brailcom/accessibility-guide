== 1. Install the Ubuntu Desktop == install

 1) Download the Ubuntu installation ISO image at http://www.ubuntu.com/ . 
 2) Burn it onto a CD or flash disk
 3) Restart your computer and boot from the CD or flash disk
 4) Go through the installation process

=== Installation process without sight === install-without-sight

In recent versions of Ubuntu, it is theoretically possible to install the
system without sighted help. In practice however it is only recommendable
to a skilled user, because it brings some significant challenges and requires
that you are already able to operate the Orca screen reader. Bellow is described
how to install Ubuntu 10.10 without sight:

 1. Boot from the installation CD (see the general [#install installation
 instructions] for how to get it.
 2. Wait for some time (like 3-5 minutes) to be sure the system has loaded
 3. Press >>TAB<<, >>ENTER<< to select English as the default language and
 start a live version of the system from CD
 4. Wait until you hear the startup melody in your speakers
 5. Press >>ALT+F2<< and type '>>orca<<' to launch the screen reader
 6. This will actually start a self-voicing configuration dialog, answer the
 questions
 7. Answer ``Automatically start Orca when you login - YES'', ``Logout now --
 YES''
 8. On hearing the login prompt sound, type '>>ubuntu ENTER ENTER<<' to login
 back as user ubuntu with an empty password.
 9. You will once again hear the startup melody.
 10. Now you should be setup with the screen reader.
 11. >>ALT-F1<< will bring you to the main Gnome menu. Press >>Rigtht<<, select
 'Places', press down key repeatedly to select 'Desktop'
 12. A file browser dialog opens. By moving around with your cursor, you can
 find the 'Install Ubuntu 10.10' icon, click it
 13. This will start the installer, which is now accessible using Orca and you
 should be able to go through it and install the system. Be aware however that
 there will be periods of silence as the installer doesn't report progress in
 any audible way.
 14. At the end, you will be asked to reboot. Make sure you take the CD out
 before you boot again.

== 2. Boot into the newly installed system ==

After you reboot your computer after successful installation, you should hear
the login prompt sound (drums). Here select your user name, type ENTER, then
input your passowrd and type enter. If you then hear the login prompt again
(drums), there was something wrong with the username and password you have
given, and you need to repeat. Otherwise you will hear a startup melody.

After hearing the startup melody, type ALT-F2 orca ENTER. This will start a
self-voicing configuration dialog for the Orca screen reader. Go through it to
set your prefered settings and at the end agree to logout. Repeat the login and
you should have a system now which automatically starts with a talking screen
reader -- Orca.

== 3. Install additional packages ==

 * Install Speech Dispatcher, Festival, BrlTTY, Orca, Emacs and speechd-el
using the following command:

-----
sudo apt-get install speechd festival festival-freebsoft-utils emacs speechd-el
-----

 * [ubuntu-brltty Install the launch script for BrlTTY]

== 4. Configure Orca ==
