 2) Burn it onto a CD or flash disk
 3) Restart your computer and boot from the CD or flash disk
 4) Go through the installation process

=== Installation process without sight ===

In recent versions of Ubuntu, it is theoretically possible to install the
system without sighted help. In practice however it is only recommendable
to a skilled user, because it brings some significant challenges and requires
that you are already able to operate the Orca screen reader. Bellow is described
how to install Ubuntu 10.10 without sight:

 1. Boot from the installation CD (see the general [#install installation instructions] for how to get it.
 2. Wait for some time (like 3-5 minutes) to be sure the system has loaded
 3. Press TAB, ENTER to select English as the default language and start a live version of the system from CD
 4. Wait until you hear the startup melody in your speakers
 5. Press ALT-F2 and type 'orca' to launch the screen reader
 6. This will actually start a self-voicing configuration dialog, answer the questions
 7. Answer ``Automatically start Orca when you login - YES'', ``Logout now -- YES''
 8. On hearing the login prompt sound, type 'ubuntu ENTER ENTER' to login back as user ubuntu with an empty password.
 9. You will once again hear the startup melody.
 10. Now you should be setup with the screen reader.
 11. 'ALT-F1' will bring you to the main Gnome menu. Press right, select Places, press down key repeatedly to select 'Desktop'
 12. A file browser dialog opens. By moving around with your cursor, you can find the 'Install Ubuntu 10.10' icon, click it
 13. This will start the installer, which is now accessible using Orca and you should be able to go through it and install
 the system. Be aware however that there will be periods of silence as the installer doesn't report progress in any audible way.
 14. At the end, you will be asked to reboot. Make sure you take the CD out before you boot again.

== 2. Boot into the newly installed system ==

After you reboot your computer after successful installation, you should hear
the login prompt sound (drums). Here select your user name, type ENTER, then input
your passowrd and type enter. If you then hear the login prompt again (drums), there
was something wrong with the username and password you have given, and you need to
repeat. Otherwise you will hear a startup melody.

After hearing the startup melody, type ALT-F2 orca ENTER. This will start a self-voicing
configuration dialog for the Orca screen reader. Go through it to set your prefered
settings and at the end agree to logout. Repeat the login and you should have a system
now which automatically starts with a talking screen reader -- Orca.

== 3. Install additional packages ==

 * Install Speech Dispatcher, Festival, BrlTTY, Orca, Emacs and speechd-el using the following
command:

-----
sudo apt-get install speechd festival festival-freebsoft-utils emacs speechd-el
